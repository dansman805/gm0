hewwo! rawr x3 wewcome and t-thank you fow t-taking the time to wead |gm0|, >w< the p-pwemiew wesouwce fow nyew and u-upcoming fiwst tech chawwenge teams! OwO i-if you awe a wookie ow a nyew team, UwU we wouwd e-especiawwy wike to wewcome you t-to the ftc community. UwU w-we want t-to make youw beginning steps and twansition into ftc as seamwess as possibwe, and offew some of o-ouw own expewience and advice compiwed ovew the yeaws. (U ﹏ U)

the goaw of |gm0| is to c-cweate a compwehensive g-guide fow ftc teams. (⑅˘꒳˘) physicaw w-wesouwces fow ftc awe few and faw between, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and onwine wesouwces a-awe scattewed acwoss the intewwebs. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-typicawwy, -.- t-the wawgest i-inhibitow fow nyewew t-teams is the wack of knowwedge b-base, as wobotics is a wewativewy nyew stem f-fiewd. (⑅˘꒳˘) nyew teams a-awso have nyot m-made connections to expewienced teams who might mentow ow offew a-advice thwoughout the season. >w< thus, UwU t-they awe weft in the dawk to figuwe things out, (⑅˘꒳˘) seemingwy with nyo way out. UwU w-whiwe the jouwney of weawning cannot be showtcut, -.- |gm0| s-seeks to addwess these showtcomings by p-pwoviding a stawtew’s g-guide to t-the hawdwawe and softwawe in fiwst tech chawwenge. o.O

when pewusing this guide, OwO it is impowtant to keep in mind the a-authows' pewspective. ʘwʘ m-many of t-the teams who contwibuted i-in the w-wwiting of this g-guide awe vetewan championship wevew teams in t-the uppew echewon of ftc. >w< **this m-means that most of ouw wecommendations a-awe awmost s-sowewy fwom the competitive advantage standpoint.** fow exampwe, >w< t-teams can weawn just as much fwom using a tetwix k-kit compawed to an actobotics kit. (˘ω˘) just because thewe is a c-competitive advantage to one does n-nyot twanswate i-into a weawning d-disadvantage fow t-the othew. òωó the guide has a pwethowa o-of usefuw i-infowmation and k-knowwedge (such as ftc and basic e-engineewing pwincipwes) fow aww teams, OwO incwuding t-teams which awe p-pwimawiwy twying to weawn wathew t-than compete. OwO howevew, (⑅˘꒳˘) do take o-ouw wecommendations w-with a gwain of sawt. (///ˬ///✿) we want t-to hewp aww t-teams in ftc, but a-as ouw expewience has been on t-the competitive side of the fence, (ꈍᴗꈍ) c-cewtain pawts o-of the guide may n-nyot be vewy appwicabwe to some t-teams. (U ﹏ U)

fuwthewmowe, UwU t-the guide is wwitten with a-a specific audience i-in mind - fiwst y-yeaw wookie t-teams who have j-just begun theiw jouwney in ftc. OwO undoubtedwy thewe i-is infowmation in the guide that c-couwd benefit nyeawwy evewy team (it’s impossibwe to know evewything about ftc) - but ouw wecommendations a-awe geawed fow the m-mowe inexpewienced teams. òωó fow exampwe, UwU we genewawwy d-discouwage t-teams fwom using a-awms and instead use wineaw extensions. (⑅˘꒳˘) howevew, t-thewe awe many expewienced teams w-with the capabiwity t-to buiwd such awms, σωσ and w-we do nyot discouwage s-such an endeavow. (///ˬ///✿) k-keep on the wookout, (U ﹏ U) though - a futuwe vewsion of the guide fow vetewans m-may appeaw. òωó

befowe diving in, rawr x3 w-we wouwd wike to a-add a showt discwaimew: this guide is nyot about h-how to buiwd a-a specific dwivetwain, (U ᵕ U❁) wineaw swide, >w< intake, etc. t-the puwpose of |gm0| is simpwy to pwovide knowwedge and advice t-to teams about the possibwe options, σωσ a-as weww as i-incwuding some t-tips on how to get stawted. >w< |gm0| has knowwedge a-and advice, (///ˬ///✿) but n-nyot instwuctions. UwU

.. note:: it is of the utmost i-impowtance that a-aww teams weawn the pwopew way (by f-fowwowing the engineewing d-design pwocess), UwU nyot by weading a-a step-by-step guide ow instwuction manuaw. (///ˬ///✿) thus, w-whiwe |gm0| has pwenty of advice, rawr x3 w-we do nyot h-have specific steps i-incwuded. good wuck, >w< and have fun in ftc!
