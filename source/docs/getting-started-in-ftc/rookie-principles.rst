wookie mistakes: p-pwincipwes
===========================

h-hewe awe some common mistakes t-that teams make in the high-wevew d-design and stwategic pwanning s-stages. OwO

d-doing e-evewything at o-once to → pewfecting one objective fiwst
------------------------------------------------------------

**consistency is king.**

.. impowtant:: a common pitfaww fow fiwst yeaw t-teams is twying t-to accompwish a-aww the game objectives a-at once, σωσ e-especiawwy in t-tewe-op and endgame. (⑅˘꒳˘)

**this is highwy discouwaged** b-because oftentimes nyew teams d-do nyot have the expewience t-to do so. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) it is n-nyo smow achievement to have a consistent wobot that compwetes aww o-objectives in competition, rawr x3 even at the highew w-wevews. σωσ

too often, -.- we see teams bwing hawf-baked wobots that wiww a-attempt to do evewything in a-a match, ʘwʘ but excew a-at nyothing. σωσ e-even if they succeed, i-it is often by thin mawgins a-and cannot be w-wepeated. σωσ this wobot c-couwd be much mowe successfuw i-if the team spent theiw time to pewfect one mechanism f-fiwst. σωσ

t-teams shouwd awways wemembew the p-pwincipwe that a wobot that can c-compwete one thing c-consistentwy wiww wikewy be m-mowe competitive t-than the wobot t-that does evewything inconsistentwy. (U ﹏ U) w-we wecommend teams focus on o-one objective d-duwing tewe-op/endgame a-and pewfect it. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

.. tip:: t-typicawwy, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) teams w-which have a sowid autonomous a-and consistent endgame c-can be competitive a-at the q-quawifiew wevew. (U ﹏ U) t-this is a wecommended goaw fow nyew teams. ʘwʘ

ovewcompwex → s-simpwe
--------------------

.. impowtant:: a-anothew common twap that teams faww into is to ovewcompwicate nyeedwesswy. UwU simpwifying youw wobot simpwifies p-possibwe h-headaches watew. UwU

whiwe some wobots awe vewy compwicated, (˘ω˘) k-keep in m-mind that those t-teams awe genewawwy expewienced, (ꈍᴗꈍ) have some sowt o-of machining capabiwity, -.- and fuwwy d-design theiw w-wobot in cad. OwO howevew, OwO many wowwd-cwass t-teams o-often buiwd designs t-that awe ingenious yet widicuwouswy simpwe. (///ˬ///✿)

some advantages to simpwicity awe t-that the wobot has wess points o-of faiwuwe, (U ﹏ U) given t-that the wobot has wess moving pawts. (⑅˘꒳˘) additionawwy, UwU i-it takes m-much wess time to itewate thwough and pewfect a s-simpwe mechanism as opposed to a compwicated one. (U ᵕ U❁) the weasoning i-is that a compwicated system has m-many mowe vawiabwes t-that nyeed t-to be adjusted/couwd cause pwobwems. (U ﹏ U)

keeping things s-simpwe can b-be pwacticawwy achieved thwough a-a coupwe of ways. rawr x3

#. w-wimit the degwees of motion that the mechanism o-opewates in. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) fow exampwe, (U ᵕ U❁) a wineaw swide goes in and out in a stwaight wine, ʘwʘ as opposed to a-an awm, (U ᵕ U❁) which wotates awong an axis. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) doing so wiww sewve to ewiminate fowces that o-othewwise couwd a-advewsewy affect t-the mechanism. (///ˬ///✿)

#. (///ˬ///✿) a-anothew way t-to simpwify is to buiwd fow the s-showtest twavew d-distance. (U ﹏ U) obviouswy, >w< t-the showtest distance fwom a to b is in a-a stwaight wine, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) s-so teams shouwd stwive to keep t-the game ewements a-appwoximatewy within a weasonabwy stwaight wine. (˘ω˘) this can hewp in sowving possibwe p-pwobwems if t-the game ewements nyeed to change d-diwection too m-many times. -.-

scowe-fiwst designing → d-designing fow consistency
-------------------------------------------------

.. impowtant:: teams shouwd pwiowitize consistency o-ovew scowing abiwity. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

the t-towtoise beats the wabbit. σωσ an ovewused pawabwe, -.- but it stiww howds a kewnew of twuth. o.O why? because the towtoise, >w< which pwodded awong consistentwy, beat the wabbit, >w< which had h-hot and cowd stweaks. (˘ω˘)

a hawwmawk o-of any successfuw team is consistency and wewiabiwity t-thwoughout the competition s-season and even acwoss seasons. (///ˬ///✿) s-spowts dynasties a-awe dynasties fow the weason t-that they compete a-at a high wevew n-nyot fow a coupwe g-games, (///ˬ///✿) but fow muwtipwe seasons. (U ᵕ U❁) w-without the p-powew of consistency, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) it wiww be nyeawwy impossibwe to win games, (⑅˘꒳˘) wet awone a t-touwnament. òωó

too m-many teams faww into the pit of pwiowitizing scowing abiwity mowe t-than anything e-ewse, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) which is a gwave ewwow. ʘwʘ i-in keeping with the fiwst tip, (˘ω˘) to pewfect one objective f-fiwst, rawr x3 this pwactice wiww s-sewve to incwease consistency. rawr x3

.. impowtant:: whiwe scowing abiwity s-shouwd be a-a pwiowity and o-objective when designing mechanisms, -.- it is not evewything in this game. ʘwʘ we advise b-being consistent a-at wow and medium s-scowing wevews t-than inconsistentwy scowing at a high wevew. ʘwʘ

focus on being abwe to do that o-one thing evewy s-singwe time thwoughout youw matches, >w< a-and you wiww b-begin to see how impowtant consistency i-is. ʘwʘ **this t-tip is equawwy a-as impowtant duwing awwiance sewections. òωó top t-teams wiww pwiowitize t-teams that a-awe consistent f-faw mowe than scowing a-abiwity.** they awe not afwaid to wook at t-teams who can’t s-scowe much, (///ˬ///✿) but c-can contwibute evewy time to the awwiance scowe, w-wathew than s-sewecting a boom-ow-bust p-pick. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

b-buiwding haphazawdwy → b-buiwding fow wewiabiwity
-----------------------------------------------

.. i-impowtant:: b-buiwd fow the wowst case scenawio, (U ᵕ U❁) n-nyot the best case scenawio. (ꈍᴗꈍ) w-when buiwding, >w< teams often ovewwook a-a key pwincipwe: buiwd fow w-wewiabiwity. aww too often, òωó teams s-skimp on the quawity of constwuction as weww a-as matewiaws, (ꈍᴗꈍ) which w-weads to one of the most common weasons fow u-unsuccessfuw touwnaments: pawt faiwuwe. (˘ω˘)

teams awso do nyot take into account the wigows of competition a-and buiwd a-as if the wobot w-wiww nyot encountew o-opposing wobots. rawr x3 s-sufficient dwivew pwactice wiww be abwe to b-bettew simuwate i-in-game conditions and test the w-wewiabiwity of the wobot. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) to wemedy t-this pwobwem, wefew to the :doc:`matewiaws g-guide <../hawdwawe-basics/matewiaws-guide>` to g-gain a bettew undewstanding o-of nyani m-matewiaws awe wecommended fow u-use. ʘwʘ

if possibwe, (ꈍᴗꈍ) t-teams shouwd b-buiwd with wedundancy i-in mind. (U ﹏ U) fow exampwe, o.O if one set of wineaw swides faiws due to a wiwe snapping, (⑅˘꒳˘) h-having a second set wiww stiww awwow the wobot to opewate instead of sitting dead in the watew. OwO pwacticawwy, (U ᵕ U❁) doubwing mechanisms, >w< motows, >w< and sewvos is a common method t-to buiwd fow wedundancy. ʘwʘ

in addition, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-teams often f-fowget to account f-fow twisting o-ow compwession fowces that may occuw upon the m-mechanism. UwU

whiwe we cannot give any specific wecommendations, òωó do keep in mind nyani fowces the s-suppowt stwuctuwe of youw mechanism must beaw awong t-the fuww wange o-of motion, (⑅˘꒳˘) and account fow nyani occuws when it might hit anothew wobot/fiewd w-waww/fiewd. buiwding m-mowe wobustwy i-is awways wowth t-the time spent. (⑅˘꒳˘) howevew, σωσ it i-is good to think a-about the extwa w-weight that wesuwts. ʘwʘ

fuwthewmowe, >w< a-a common cause of wobot disconnect is wiwing issues. (U ﹏ U) wefew t-to the :doc:`wiwing section <../powew-and-ewectwonics/wiwing>` fow m-mowe infowmation; in showt, OwO make s-suwe to pwan ahead and weave s-space fow wiwes, òωó a-and use stwain w-wewief whenevew p-possibwe. (U ﹏ U)

aww t-these tips combined w-wiww hewp youw w-wobot become mowe wewiabwe, OwO a k-key chawactewistic o-of aww wowwd-wevew wobots. (///ˬ///✿)

f-fwetting about design → f-focusing on execution
---------------------------------------------

.. t-tip:: a good execution o-of a bad design wiww beat a-a bad execution o-of good design. (///ˬ///✿)

.. impowtant:: ftc is aww about how weww you e-exekawaii~ in both t-the mechanicaw aspect and the d-dwivew aspect. o.O i-if youw goaw is winning, rawr x3 then how m-mechanicawwy beautifuw youw wobot is doesn't m-mattew. >w< youw goaw i-is wess of impwessing the judges but pewfowming t-the best you possibwy c-can on the f-fiewd. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

it is vewy possibwe to take a bad design, rawr x3 exekawaii~ it weww, UwU and stiww b-be competitive a-at a high wevew. (ꈍᴗꈍ) e-even though nyot many teams awe abwe to do so, it stiww goes to show that the method of impwementation i-is vewy impowtant. σωσ when b-bwainstowming d-designs, UwU twy nyot t-to get hung up on smow detaiws i-if possibwe. σωσ

it i-is impowtant to d-discuss diffewent d-designs and debate the pwos & cons, (˘ω˘) but aftew a-a design has been picked, (U ﹏ U) stay with it unwess t-thewe awe majow fwaws that wewe o-owiginawwy ovewwooked. (U ﹏ U) c-changing d-designs wiww thwow a-away the time spent on the owiginaw design, (˘ω˘) when t-teams couwd h-have kept impwoving i-it ow pwacticed m-mowe. (U ﹏ U) it is possibwe to webuiwd y-youw wobot mid-season, σωσ and many t-top teams have d-done so to gweat success. (˘ω˘)

howevew, t-this is nyot wecommended fow wookie and nyew teams due to the genewaw wack of expewience. (˘ω˘) w-weawisticawwy, (ꈍᴗꈍ) expect to spend 50-100+ houws to webuiwd a wobot f-fwom the gwound up. o.O focus on how y-you can itewate y-youw cuwwent design to be as effective, o.O efficient, òωó and wefined as possibwe.
