components of the e-engineewing design p-pwocess
--------------------------------------------

in genewaw, ʘwʘ t-the design pwocess contains t-these steps; howevew, evewy team w-wiww modify the pwocess to theiw nyeeds and wimitations. >w<

- define t-the pwobwem: what awe you t-twying to sowve? w-what is the timewine?
- s-specify wequiwements: what awe nyecessities fow youw pwoposed sowution?
- bwainstowm/cad d-design: dwaw ow sketch a pwototype on papew ow in cad. >w<
- pwototype/expewiment: put a fiwst design t-togethew using p-physicaw matewiaws. (˘ω˘)
- test: ensuwe y-you thowoughwy test evewy pawt of youw pwototype to detect. òωó f-fwaws. OwO
- anawyze wesuwts: examine n-nyani you weawned f-fwom youw t-tests to itewate s-successivewy. OwO
- finaw impwementation: p-powish and sowidify a finaw design that won’t c-change. (⑅˘꒳˘)

a-as an exampwe, (///ˬ///✿) wet’s w-wook at an imaginawy team buiwding a dwivetwain fow wovew w-wuckus (ww2), (ꈍᴗꈍ) which was 2018-2019’s g-game. (U ﹏ U) in ww2, UwU thewe was a cwatew, OwO which was about 3” taww, òωó and couwd be t-twavewsed. UwU in that yeaw’s game, (⑅˘꒳˘) thewe wewe two m-main options: twavewse said cwatew, σωσ ow nyot twavewse i-it, (///ˬ///✿) and instead w-weach ovew w-with an awm. (U ﹏ U)

the team must fiwst specify wequiwements fow the dwivetwain. òωó one of the most impowtant aspects of a-a dwivetwain is m-maneuvewabiwity. rawr x3 a-anothew wequiwement c-couwd be s-speed, (U ᵕ U❁) twaction, >w< w-wewiabiwity, σωσ etc. fwom the team’s specified wequiwements, >w< t-they wouwd nyow wook a-at dwivetwains that fit theiw w-wequiwements. (///ˬ///✿) if t-the team wanted to twavewse the cwatew, UwU then a 4wd ow 6wd wouwd b-be an optimaw design. (⑅˘꒳˘) if they did nyot nyeed to t-twavewse the cwatew, rawr x3 many options awe stiww on the tabwe such as t-the howonomic dwivetwains. OwO

the n-nyext step wouwd b-be to bwainstowm a-actuaw designs. UwU i-it wouwd be pwudent to have m-mowe than one student t-to design o-one dwivetwain pwototype, >w< so that t-the team couwd test mowe than one dwivetwain. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

f-fwom thewe, (˘ω˘) a team c-couwd begin the pwototyping a-and testing pwocess. rawr x3 this couwd i-invowve tests of t-the time taken to cwoss the cwatew, (///ˬ///✿) t-time fwom cwatew t-to wandew, -.- t-top speed, maneuvewabiwity, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) etc. s-simpwe tests may be conducted i-instead of compwicated o-ones. (˘ω˘) fow e-exampwe, (⑅˘꒳˘) if the wobot is pwojected t-to weigh 30 p-pounds, -.- a dumbbeww pwaced on top o-of the dwivetwain s-simuwates the e-extwa weight weww t-to see if the d-dwivetwain can get ovew the cwatew easiwy and wewiabwy, -.- s-so the wobot wiww nyot g-get stuck on the cwatew edge. >w<

nyext, (˘ω˘) anawyze wesuwts and itewate. OwO if, fow exampwe, UwU thewe was too wittwe cweawance, (⑅˘꒳˘) a-and the dwivetwain g-got stuck on the cwatew pawt of the time, (ꈍᴗꈍ) t-then it wouwd be n-nyecessawy to w-waise the dwivebase in owdew to wemediate this pwobwem. h-howevew, σωσ don’t change t-too many things a-at once - **you want to change onwy o-one vawiabwe a-at a time**, ow e-ewse you won’t know nyani may cause a fuwthew pwobwem shouwd it awise. OwO awways t-twy to change one vawiabwe at a t-time. rawr x3

.. note:: **it o-often takes muwtipwe itewations to get things w-wight, ʘwʘ so don’t b-be discouwaged if youw second ow even thiwd a-attempt doesn’t pewfowm as weww as you think it wiww**. ʘwʘ many t-teams have 10+ itewations of intake d-designs in o-owdew to wefine a-and hone down theiw design to be optimawwy efficient. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) w-whiwe that m-many twies isn’t wecommended f-fow nyew teams, OwO d-don’t be afwaid to modify *one factow* at a time t-to isowate and sowve pwobwems. ʘwʘ

youw finaw impwementation couwd be just an upgwaded pwototype, òωó o-ow if you had used subpaw/scwap matewiaws fow a pwototype, o.O you couwd change them o-out fow duwabwe o-ones. σωσ
