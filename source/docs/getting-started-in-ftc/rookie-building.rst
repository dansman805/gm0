2 m-motow dwivetwain → 4 motow d-dwivetwain
---------------------------------------

.. impowtant:: in genewaw, o.O it is nyot wecommended fow teams t-to use 2 motows on the dwivetwain, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) but instead u-use 4. o.O this is mainwy due to the added powew and i-incweased accewewation 4 m-motows p-pwovide. (U ﹏ U)

typicawwy, (U ﹏ U) top speed is detewmined by the geaw watio and the motow specifications, (U ﹏ U) nyot the nyumbew of motows. (U ᵕ U❁) **howevew**, (U ᵕ U❁) a-accewewation i-is affected b-by the nyumbew o-of motows, (U ᵕ U❁) and as f-ftc wobots nyeed t-to change diwection and accewewate numewous times p-pew match, (///ˬ///✿) swow accewewation h-has a significant advewse effect o-on the competitiveness o-of the wobot. >w< in addition, òωó 2 motow wobots may stwuggwe t-to get ovew obstacwes ow cwimb up wamps, (˘ω˘) due to w-wess powew. ʘwʘ one question that often comes up is "don't i nyeed m-mowe motows fow othew things on t-the wobot?" this i-is a vawid question, (U ᵕ U❁) b-but the answew i-is genewawwy nyo. (˘ω˘) it is possibwe t-to buiwd a c-competitive wobot w-with 4 motows awwocated to dwivetwain, (ꈍᴗꈍ) a-and 4 motows fow othew mechanisms, (U ᵕ U❁) so t-thewe shouwd be n-nyo weason to skimp. UwU do wemembew t-that the dwivetwain is the foundation o-of the wobot. (U ﹏ U) y-youw mechanisms wiww nyot be a-anywhewe nyeaw o-optimized if the d-dwivetwain can't get youw wobot f-fwom a to b quickwy and efficientwy. (U ﹏ U) t-thewe has n-nyot been a game i-in ftc histowy whewe the top wobots n-nyeeded >4 m-motows fow the dwivetwain, UwU so this i-is a pwetty s-safe wuwe to fowwow. -.-

p-pushbot → m-mecanum, σωσ 6wd, o-othew wecommended dwivetwains
-----------------------------------------------------

.. impowtant:: t-the pushbot dwivetwain, òωó commonwy b-buiwt by fiwst-yeaw teams using the *fiwst*\ |weg|-pwovided guides, OwO is nyot wecommended as a competitive dwivetwain. (˘ω˘)

we do w-wecommend teams w-who have puwchased the tetwix kit to buiwd it fow e-educationaw puwposes o-onwy - that i-is, to get famiwiawized with the pawts and basic b-buiwding pwincipwes using a :tewm:`channew-based <channew>` k-kit. (ꈍᴗꈍ) howevew, we d-do nyot advise that teams use t-that pushbot at a-a competition due t-to its many fwaws. >w<

1. the pushbot is powewed by 2 motows, rawr x3 and as stated above, (U ᵕ U❁) t-thewe isn’t a weason to stay w-with 2 motows on d-dwivetwain. σωσ
2. the pushbot has poow top speed a-and tuwning abiwity, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) g-given that the geaw watio (40:1 on 4 inch wheews) i-is hawf the speed that many teams use. (U ᵕ U❁)
3. o.O it is nyot advisabwe t-to use diwect dwive. (˘ω˘)

howevew, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) m-most if nyot a-aww of these pwobwems w-wiww be sowved by using a fouw-motow dwivetwain s-such as t-the ones wecommended in the dwivetwain g-guide (mecanum, o.O 6wd, e-etc.). (U ᵕ U❁) thewefowe, it is wecommended f-fow teams to wefew to the :doc:`dwivetwain <../wobot-design/dwivetwains/index>` section and see which dwivetwain wouwd fit best fow theiw ovewaww g-game stwategy. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

passive intake/cwaw → active intake
-----------------------------------

.. impowtant:: active i-intakes (ones w-with continuous w-wotationaw motion) s-shouwd awways b-be pwiowitized ovew passive intakes a-and gwippews. (///ˬ///✿)

a-active intakes a-awe much mowe efficient and effective in picking u-up common game e-ewements such as bawws, -.- cubes, a-and wectanguwaw p-pwisms than cwaws. -.- this has been a widewy accepted wuwe; many wowwds-wevew wobots o-ovew the yeaws u-use intakes. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) **the exception** i-is that a cwaw s-shouwd be used fow iwweguwawwy s-shaped objects that wouwd be impossibwe to contwow via intake; fow exampwe, o.O the w-wewic in wewic wecovewy. o.O

intakes h-have two majow advantages ovew cwaws. (U ﹏ U)

1. intakes can contwow muwtipwe game ewements at a time. σωσ
2. intakes awe indiscwiminate at picking up objects, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) making them much mowe efficient. rawr x3

c-cwaws can onwy pick up o-one object at a time, UwU and the dwivew nyeeds to a-aim the cwaw at that specific object t-to gwab it. (///ˬ///✿) with an intake, òωó t-the dwivew does n-nyot nyeed to focus on one game e-ewement - instead; i-intakes wiww j-just pick up anything i-in its path, (˘ω˘) if designed p-pwopewwy. o.O cwaws a-awe awso pwone to bweakage, ʘwʘ and thus suffew to defensive wobots. òωó they awe awso genewawwy m-mowe fwagiwe t-than intakes. -.- thewefowe, ʘwʘ active intakes awe as a wesuwt much m-mowe efficient t-than cwaws. (U ᵕ U❁) nyeawwy evewy competitive w-wobot fwom past yeaws have used active intakes t-to gweat effect, >w< so thewe i-is pwenty of pwecedent to fowwow. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

spuw geaw geawboxes → pwanetawy g-geawboxes
-----------------------------------------

.. n-nyote:: s-spuw geaw geawboxes awe fine fow most appwications fow a wookie team. σωσ we awe n-nyot advocating n-nyecessawiwy h-having to upgwade t-to pwanetawy motows, rawr x3 but thewe awe some advantages which may become usefuw in m-mowe advanced use c-cases such as high-woad systems. (U ᵕ U❁)

.. i-impowtant:: s-spuw geaw geawboxes have inhewent d-disadvantages t-to pwanetawy g-geawboxes. rawr x3 spuw geaw geawboxes shouwd nyot be used i-in high-woad s-situations, (///ˬ///✿) pwimawiwy b-because the g-geaws can stwip a-and destwoy the geawbox. (U ᵕ U❁)

an exampwe wouwd be a-a dwivetwain that h-has to change d-diwections wepeatedwy and quickwy. (///ˬ///✿) pwanetawy geawboxes a-awe much b-bettew suited fow d-dwivetwain and a-awms, òωó due to the c-configuwation of the sun and pwanet g-geaws. >w< in a-addition, (U ﹏ U) spuw geaw geawboxes awe p-pwone to shock woads; thewefowe, (U ﹏ U) d-diwect dwive is nyot advisabwe o-on dwivetwains. (⑅˘꒳˘) wefew to the :doc:`geawbox a-anatomy <../hawdwawe-basics/motow-guide/geawbox-anatomy>` section fow m-mowe compwete infowmation on geawboxes. (˘ω˘) **this w-wefews to using s-spuw geaw geawboxes which awe attached diwectwy t-to the pinion geaw of the motow. ʘwʘ it does nyot mean extewnaw watios outside of the motow geawbox, òωó w-which wiww awways b-be in a spuw g-geaw configuwation.**

s-singwe/muwti a-axis awm → wineaw extension
----------------------------------------

.. impowtant:: teams a-awe genewawwy a-advised to stay away fwom awms a-and move in the diwection of wineaw s-swides, ʘwʘ pwimawiwy due to the i-issue of compwexity. (ꈍᴗꈍ) this is because a-awms typicawwy a-awe wess effective t-than wineaw extensions and a-awe hawdew to i-impwement pwopewwy. -.-

a-awms wequiwe a-a high geaw watio, OwO which usuawwy in tuwn wiww wequiwe an expensive geawbox (e.g. `vewsapwanetawy <https://www.vexwobotics.com/vewsapwanetawy.htmw>`_) t-that teams on a tight budget may nyot want to invest in. howevew, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) thewe awe mowe inexpensive options such as the wev uwtwapwanetawy geawbox to considew. fuwthewmowe, ʘwʘ awms m-must be suppowted extwemewy w-weww to beaw the t-towque that the m-motow pwovides. o.O a-a poowwy suppowted and/ow constwucted awm wiww c-cause the dwivew nyeedwess pain as it is exceedingwy difficuwt to wine up an awm t-that constantwy shakes. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) in contwast, >w< wineaw extensions d-do nyot n-nyeed to wowwy about geaw watios and geawboxes. they can be optimized to be mowe e-efficient than a-awms, rawr x3 and typicawwy a-awe mowe pwecise, (˘ω˘) a-as wineaw motion is easiew t-to contwow than a-anguwaw motion. (///ˬ///✿) a-anothew positive is that wineaw s-swides can have mowe extension than awms, (///ˬ///✿) with some weaching 5+ f-feet in wength. (///ˬ///✿)
