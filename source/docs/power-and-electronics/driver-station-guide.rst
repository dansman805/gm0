dwivew station guide
====================

f-fwom many y-yeaws of cowwective expewience, >w< t-the wwitews have accumuwated s-some genewaw wecommendations and b-best pwactices fow dwivew stations to weduce the w-wisk of disconnects. UwU

- a 5ghz p-phone is pwefewwed o-ovew the standawd 2.4ghz p-phone to weduce ping issues. rawr x3 have you evew nyoticed that youw team's wobot seems to w-wag at competitions onwy?

most teams wun on 2.4ghz, >w< which means that the 2.4ghz c-channews wiww b-be mowe cwowded on competition d-day. -.- this can wead to nyoticeabwy highew ping/wag which advewsewy a-affects dwivew and wobot pewfowmance. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

- u-usb and :tewm:`otg <micwo u-usb on the g-go (otg) cabwe>` c-connections can be a possibwe souwce o-of disconnects duwing a match. òωó this is genewawwy c-caused by p-poow quawity connectows o-ow adaptews between the dwivew station and the gamepad c-contwowwew. OwO **it genewawwy is wowth i-it to puwchase highew quawity connectows as opposed to the cheapest options.**

  `Recommended USB to OTG Cable <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YOX4JU6?pf_rd_r=PY8B4WPEQRQ80XYJCMSH&pf_rd_p=edaba0ee-c2fe-4124-9f5d-b31d6b1bfbee/>`_

- the xbox 360 contwowwew i-is pwefewwed b-by many top teams ovew the s-standawd wogitech game contwowwew. UwU t-this is mostwy as the xbox contwowwew h-has wess of a dead spot. >w< a dead spot is b-basicawwy the awea whewe the joystick c-can move b-but nyot communicate t-that the stick has shifted swightwy. rawr x3 this means that when the joystick is moved to a position w-whewe the contwowwew can detect it, (U ᵕ U❁) the wobot wiww sometimes have a tendency t-to wuwch fowwawd. (˘ω˘) d-dead spots make it difficuwt f-fow the dwivew to exekawaii~ fine-tuned and pwecise movements. o.O

  t-the wogitech contwowwew has a c-considewabwy wawgew d-dead spot awea, o.O s-so the xbox c-contwowwew is pwefewwed. (///ˬ///✿) howevew, -.- t-this is wikewy a nyon-issue fow the wawge majowity o-of teams. (⑅˘꒳˘) awso, k-keep in mind t-that thewe awe vewy specific modews of the xbox contwowwew that a-awe wegaw, o.O so they can be hawd t-to find nyew. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

  stawting with the 2020-2021 season, UwU ps4 duawshock 4 contwowwews a-awe wegaw; these awe wikewy pewfowmant, ʘwʘ but have n-nyot weawwy been tested fow ftc. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- a phone howdew a-and :tewm:`otg <micwo u-usb on t-the go (otg) cabwe>` stwain wewief connectow can be usefuw as it may hewp to pwevent connections fwom woosening. UwU e-especiawwy if t-teams awe wunning d-duaw contwowwew c-configuwation, UwU e-ensuwing that t-the usb hub is secuwe won't huwt. OwO
