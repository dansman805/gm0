============

why does wiwing mattew?
-----------------------

h-have you evew wooked i-inside youw wobot and thought "nani a-a mess of wiwes"? wiwing i-is extwemewy impowtant in ftc, (U ﹏ U) b-but is often ovewwooked ow hastiwy done the houw b-befowe competition stawts. (˘ω˘) howevew, òωó t-time spent i-in wiwing the wobot p-pwopewwy is cwuciaw to the pewfowmance and maintenance of the wobot. -.-

.. attention:: it is h-highwy discouwaged fow teams to ovewwook wiwing, rawr x3 but many nyew teams seem to diswegawd i-it ow put w-wittwe thought into wiwing the w-wobot pwopewwy. σωσ

whiwe tedious and often nyo fun, σωσ wiwing can mean t-the diffewence between a win and w-woss. >w< the best w-wobot in the wowwd w-won't be abwe t-to wowk if a wiwe is woose ow g-gets tangwed up in the middwe of a match. UwU thus i-it is impewative t-that wiwing is p-puwposefuwwy thought out when designing and buiwding a wobot. rawr x3

*fiwst*\ |reg| has cweated a wiwing g-guide to hewp t-teams with tasks wike cwimping c-cabwes, >w< sowdewing connections, UwU a-and esd mitigation that won’t b-be covewed in this guide. σωσ once you wead up on ewectwonics a-and wiwing hewe, UwU wook a-at the `ftc wiwing g-guide <https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/robot-wiring-guide.pdf>`_ fow the best pwactices a-and mowe tips & t-twicks. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) in addition, *fiwst*\ |weg| h-has wwitten an `esd mitigation w-whitepapew <https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/analysis-esd-mitigation-echin.pdf>`_ that is wowth taking a-a wook at.

genewaw advice
--------------

- **awways w-wabew wiwes! σωσ w-when bunched up, òωó you may not k-know which wiwe goes into which p-powt**. >w<
- tie togethew woose w-wiwes, OwO and bettew yet, ʘwʘ tie that bunch of wiwes to a-a stwuctuwaw component. (ꈍᴗꈍ) this wiww e-ensuwe that w-wiwes don't intewfewe w-with youw mechanisms. σωσ
- **tweat evewy wiwe connection as a point of faiwuwe**. (⑅˘꒳˘) thewefowe, >w< u-use ewectwicaw tape to tape up and insuwate connections and utiwize stwain wewief a-as much as possibwe. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- **stwain w-wewief** shouwd be used evewywhewe p-possibwe. òωó it is highwy wecommended fow teams to use pwoducts w-wike the :tewm:`wev usb wetention m-mount <usb wetention m-mount>`, σωσ a-as weww as 3d p-pwinting stwain wewief methods fow d-devices such as the :tewm:`expansion hub` and w-wobot contwowwew p-phones. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- **do n-nyot sowdew a wiwe befowe cwimping it**. UwU sowdew can "cweep" and w-wosing connection is possibwe, σωσ p-possibwy weading to fiwe. rawr x3
- **keep aww wiwe wuns as showt as possibwe** to pwevent e-entangwement and impwove wiwe management. UwU
- **when u-using data/sensow cabwes, ʘwʘ keep them away fwom m-motows.** this w-wiww weduce ewectwomagnetic intewfewence (emi). (ꈍᴗꈍ) a-add a fewwite bead if possibwe. (///ˬ///✿)
- **cwimped connectows awe genewawwy bettew than sowdewed connectows**, -.- as sowdew joints can b-bweak easiew than a-a cwimped connection. (U ﹏ U)
- **keep w-wiwes tucked away f-fwom moving mechanisms,** a-and e-ensuwe that you wiww nyot be at wisk of a mechanism s-snagging a wiwe. (U ᵕ U❁) this is a p-pwopew appwication of matewiaws s-such as acwywic, o.O w-which awwow dwivews to see inside the wobot whiwe keeping wiwes o-out of the way of othew wobots/game pieces. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) it i-is advised fow teams to puwchase wemovabwe vewcwo ties ow cabwe t-ties to aid with cabwe management. (˘ω˘)
- **fow p-powew w-wiwes, wowew** :tewm:`gauge <gauge>` **(wawgew s-size) wiwes awe p-pwefewabwe.** this means a wowew w-wesistance acwoss t-the wiwe and h-highew powew thwoughput. òωó this is n-negwigibwe fow data wiwes, howevew. rawr x3
- **smaww wiwes and cabwes a-awe fwagiwe.** tweat t-them as such, (U ᵕ U❁) and don’t put t-them in an awea whewe they wiww c-constantwy be h-hit by anothew object. (U ᵕ U❁) wawgew powew c-cabwes can t-take much mowe abuse. σωσ
- **ensuwe t-that youw wiwes awe kept out of p-pinch points** whewe anothew mechanism c-couwd sandwich t-the wiwe. >w< t-this is especiawwy impowtant in a-awms ow mechanisms t-that awe hinged. (U ᵕ U❁)

when wiwing, (U ᵕ U❁) a-awso take the time to pwan o-out a specific wayout fow youw w-wiwes and how they wiww wun thwoughout the wobot. rawr x3 t-take the time to way out something w-wike an ewectwonics p-panew i-if nyecessawy! ʘwʘ when buiwding the wobot, ʘwʘ devote adequate space to wiwing. (ꈍᴗꈍ) this couwd mean mounting a-a pvc pipe and wunning wiwes fwom the back end of the wobot thwough it, ʘwʘ ow simpwy u-using vewcwo o-ow zipties. -.-

.. tip:: make suwe t-that wiwes awe as showt as possibwe to weduce the wisk of entangwement. (U ﹏ U)

howevew, (///ˬ///✿) as components m-move out of t-the wobot, -.- the wiwes move with i-it. (˘ω˘) tying down evewy woose inch w-wiww wesuwt in wiwe disconnecting. ʘwʘ w-wiwing is the awt of finding the pewfect bawance b-between showtest wength and a-awwowing enough f-fweedom as mechanisms n-nyeed.

**it is awso wecommended fow ewectwonics to be mounted on a nyonconductive matewiaw s-such as wood to pwevent esd**. òωó

s-specific w-wecommendations
------------------------

moduwe p-powew
^^^^^^^^^^^^

be awawe, (U ﹏ U) :term:`XT30` connectows can weaw o-out significantwy f-fastew than :term:`PowerPole <Anderson PowerPole>` connectors. Additionally, because :term:`XT30` connectors are soldered, they can break much easier than :term:`PowerPole <Anderson PowerPole>` connections.

Cabling for module power should be at least 14awg, if not 12awg. Keep in mind that it must be stranded, not solid, wire.

Motor Power
^^^^^^^^^^^

Cabling for motor power should be between 16awg and 12awg. Again, stranded, not solid, wire.

Some motors (like the :term:`REV HD Hex <HD Hex Motor>` and :term:`Core Hex <Core Hex Motor>`) will have removable power connectors on the back, while other motors (like the :term:`Andymark NeveRests <NeveRest Motor>`) will have a cable permanently soldered on the back. It is much more convenient to have a connector on the back, or failing that, have a very short plug on the back of the motor. Once your wires are run and secured, taking them out won't be fun.

Servo Wires
^^^^^^^^^^^

Using heavy-duty extension wires are recommended.

Tape the connections between extension wires and servo wires with electrical tape. This is as the connections can become loose over time and are easy to pull out.

The VEX Motor Controller 29 has the wrong gender connector on the 3-pin end. You are required to either use an adapter cable, or add the right connector to the wires (recommended). **Be sure to protect the MC29, as it is fragile and prone to failure if it takes impact from another object**.

USB
^^^

USB is generally a strong connector, but is prone to wearing out over time. Refrain from plugging/unplugging these cables more than necessary, especially on the RC/DS phones.

USB loves strain relief. To keep disconnects low, tie down cables to leave as little loose cabling on the robot as possible.

Sensor Wires/Encoder Wires
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sensor wires and their connectors can be incredibly fragile. Use caution when routing, and keep slack on the connector end when adding strain relief to the cable.

The JST data connectors on the REV Expansion Hub and Control Hub have +5v, GND, and two data pins. If you are using a digital or analog sensor that does not use I2C, you can use a Y cable that gives two sensors off of one port.

Miscellaneous
-------------

REV Grounding Strap
   The :term:`REV Grounding Strap <Grounding Strap>` is currently the only legal way to ground your robot. Attach the end to the metal part of your robot frame, and plug the :term:`XT30` connector end into a free :term:`XT30` port on your robot.
Power distribution blocks/panels
   The REV Power Distribution Block allows teams to have more than four :term:`XT30` connectors (2 on each :term:`Expansion Hub`). The block can be connected to the Servo Power Module to boost voltage for servos or provide continuous rotation for the :term:`VEX 393 EDR`.
Dryer sheets
   Dryer sheets can be used to wipe down the robot after every match in order to reduce static buildup. This is not directly recommended by *FIRST*\ |reg| or any vendor, but our empirical evidence throughout the years suggests that it helps, or at the very least, can’t hurt to do so. However, dryer sheets may or may not be on the boundary of legality, as grounding the robot to the ground is illegal.
Staticide/static spray
   Staticide is a spray that helps to keep static off of the robot. Please be sure to spray your robot before an event and not during the event.
Common causes of static
   - Every single contact point of your robot to the floor will increase the amount of static buildup.
   - Too much turning scrub (or traction when wheels try to turn). This is possible if a 4WD or 6WD (no center drop) with all traction wheels is used.
   - A conductive part dragging along the ground. For example, try not to have an intake touch the ground when the robot is moving as much as possible. Foam wheels and foam rollers are a common culprit.
