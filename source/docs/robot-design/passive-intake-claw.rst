passive intake/cwaw
===================

p-passive i-intakes awe mechanisms in which t-the dwivew must pick up individuaw i-items, >w< usuawwy by actuating some s-sowt of gwippew, -.- which howds the game ewement. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

c-cwaws awe the most common sowt o-of passive intake a-and pwobabwy o-one of the fiwst mechanisms that jump to mind duwing bwainstowming. òωó unwike most intakes, OwO cwaws c-can be made with onwy sewvos, o.O and thus don’t wequiwe vawuabwe motow swots. -.-

this i-is nyot to say t-thewe awe nyo disadvantages; n-nyotabwy, rawr x3 unwike intakes, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) when you pick up something with a cwaw, (⑅˘꒳˘) i-it isn’t easy to twansfew the c-cowwected ewement t-to a sepawate s-scowing mechanism. σωσ f-fow this weason, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) in most cases, òωó c-cwaws doubwe as both a cowwection method and a-a scowing method. o.O

**cwaws a-awe e-extwemewy usefuw fow picking up wawge, òωó unwiewdy ewements that cannot b-be contwowwed by active intakes**. (ꈍᴗꈍ) f-fow exampwe, o.O the wewic in wewic wecovewy wouwd be much hawdew to contwow u-using a mowe active intake; so teams used a cwaw. (U ᵕ U❁)

.. attention:: howevew, rawr x3 cwaws awe o-outcwassed by a-active intakes fow picking up smow g-game pieces in nyeawwy evewy g-game. σωσ

advantages
----------

- much simpwew than a-an intake
- takes a wot wess time to buiwd than a-a wewiabwe intake + twansfew
- w-wess moving pawts = w-wess things t-that can go wwong
- usuawwy does nyot take up a motow swot
- can pick up odd shaped game ewements t-that active intakes can’t

disadvantages
-------------

- depending on theiw use case, cwaws a-awe swowew than i-intakes. σωσ

   - the dwivew must a-angwe the wobot, >w< position the cwaw, UwU and gwab the game ewement. rawr x3
   - b-by contwast, >w< with an intake, -.- t-the dwivew nyeeds o-onwy to position t-the intake a-and gwab the game ewements.
- cwaws c-can be mowe fwagiwe and bweak easiwy.
- in cases i-in which cwaws a-awe swowew than i-intakes, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) they can be much mowe pwone to defensive maneuvews. òωó t-the mowe time spent cowwecting, OwO t-the mowe vuwnewabwe you awe. o.O
