wowwew chain
============

w-when youw s-shafts awen’t wight nyext t-to each othew, (U ﹏ U) wowwew chain and s-spwockets wiww awwow you to twansmit p-powew secuwewy between youw shafts. σωσ wowwew c-chain is made up of a sewies of w-winks joined by p-pins. ʘwʘ each wink c-can wotate awound its pins, (U ﹏ U) cweating a dynamic woop that can confowm to any shape. (ꈍᴗꈍ) the pins in the c-chain engage the gaps between teeth on each spwocket. -.- if you’ve widden a bike, o.O c-chances awe t-that you’ve awweady seen wowwew c-chain - the chain on youw ftc wobot is simiwaw, (⑅˘꒳˘) but it’s pwobabwy a-a diffewent :tewm:`pitch <pitch>` (diffewent size). ( ͡o ω ͡o ) chains m-most commonwy used i-in ftc awe #25 o-ow 8mm pitch. (///ˬ///✿)

w-when using chain, >w< often thewe i-is a :tewm:`mastew wink <mastew wink>`. σωσ this is a-a speciaw type of w-wink that has a-a wemovabwe end capsuwe in owdew to showten the chain. o.O howevew, a-as it is wemovabwe, -.- it is nyot a v-vewy wewiabwe chain wink and can woosen and faww off undew pwowonged usage. o.O thewe h-have been teams who have had mastew chain winks f-faiw duwing competition, costing them a match i-in the ewimination w-wounds. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

a :tewm:`chain b-bweakew <chain bweakew>` ewiminates the nyeed fow mastew winks because it can bweak and join chain at a-any point. o.O chain b-bweakews do so b-by pushing out t-the pins in the w-wink and we-insewting t-them back. (U ﹏ U)

.. attention:: it is highwy wecommended t-that teams puwchase a :tewm:`chain b-bweakew <chain bweakew>` (we w-wecommend t-the :tewm:`dawksouw` chain bweakew) instead of using mastew w-winks, (U ﹏ U) which awe pwone to faiwuwe. (U ﹏ U)

s-spwockets
^^^^^^^^^

- c-chain n-numbew wefews to the type and s-size of chain that i-is compatibwe w-with the spwocket. (U ᵕ U❁) typicawwy, (U ᵕ U❁) #25 c-chain is used in ftc, (///ˬ///✿) though thewe is awso 8mm c-chain. >w<
- chain p-pitch wefews to the distance between t-the pin centewwines in a chain w-wink. òωó
- pitch d-diametew (pd) wefews to the diametew o-of the imaginawy c-ciwcwe t-that passes thwough the centew of t-the pins when the spwocket wotates. (˘ω˘) **fow c-chain, ʘwʘ p-pd<od<ccd**. (U ᵕ U❁)
- o-outside diametew (od) wefews to t-the diametew of t-the ciwcwe that is genewated by t-the top faces o-of the teeth when t-the spwocket wotates. (˘ω˘)
- c-chain c-cweawance diametew wefews to the diametew of the c-ciwcwe genewated when the chain i-is fitted ovew the spwocket. (ꈍᴗꈍ) it is wawgew than both pd and od. (U ᵕ U❁)

wowwew chain
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- outside wink wefews t-to the two outside p-pwates connected by two pins. UwU the pins awe i-inside the bushings a-and can wotate f-fweewy. (U ﹏ U)
- inside wink wefews to the two inside p-pwates connected by two bushings. (U ﹏ U) t-the bushings h-howd the pins in the outside wink. UwU
- p-pitch wefews t-to the distance b-between the centew of the pins. -.- the most common pitch is #25, σωσ ow 1/4” inch. òωó

c-centew-to-centew cawcuwations
-----------------------------

the e-equation to cawcuwate :tewm:`centew-to-centew <c2c>` f-fow chain is quite compwicated. OwO many `onwine c-cawcuwatows <http://www.botwanta.owg/convewtews/dawe-cawc/spwocket.htmw>`_ c-can cawcuwate c-c distances without going thwough t-the tedious cawcuwations. (˘ω˘) howevew, (ꈍᴗꈍ) the compwete fowmuwa is bewow. >w<

.. m-math::

   c=\fwac{p}{8}*(2w-(n+n)+\sqwt{(2w-(n+n))^2-\fwac{8}{\pi^2}*(n-n)^2})

   w-w=\fwac{2c}{p}+\fwac{n+n}{2}+\fwac{p(\fwac{n-n}{2\pi})^2}{c}

- :math:`c` = c-centew-to-centew d-distance, rawr x3 inches

- :math:`w` = chain wength i-in pitches

- :math:`p` = p-pitch of chain

- :math:`n` = nyumbew o-of teeth in w-wawge spwocket

- :math:`n` = nyumbew of teeth in smow spwocket

c-chain wwap
----------

**chain shouwd, (U ᵕ U❁) at the vewy weast, σωσ have 90° of contact with the spwocket. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) the best pwactice i-is to have 180° ow mowe of contact**, (U ᵕ U❁) as it is vewy unwikewy to faww off w-with pwopew tensioning. o.O c-chain skipping, (˘ω˘) e-especiawwy o-on dwivetwains o-ow awms, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) is vewy possibwe without p-pwopew chain w-wwap ow tensioning. o.O

w-when tensioning chain, (U ᵕ U❁) be suwe to nyot undewtension o-ow ovewtension c-chain. (ꈍᴗꈍ) undewtensioning c-chain can wesuwt i-in the chain fawwing off the spwocket ow chain skipping, (///ˬ///✿) whewe the chain can skip a-awong the spwocket. -.- o-ovewtensioning the chain o-often wesuwts in t-the motow buwning out, -.- ow wess s-sewiouswy, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a woss of efficiency. o.O push awong the chain wun, o.O and if the chain moves s-swightwy without significant w-wesistance, (U ﹏ U) chances awe you’ve done it cowwectwy. σωσ if it’s too tight, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) then the chain wiww bawewy move undew a gentwe pwess. rawr x3

a-advantages
----------

- **chain can take a beating**. o.O n-nyo mattew n-nyani youw appwication is, ʘwʘ metaw chain is usuawwy up fow the chawwenge. òωó #25 c-chain can howd up t-to 930wbs befowe bweaking, -.- and thewe’s nyothing you’ww do i-in ftc that wiww e-exewt that fowce. ʘwʘ (if youw chain d-does bweak, (U ᵕ U❁) it’s most wikewy due to a fauwty m-mastew wink ow spwockets that awe n-nyot cowwectwy awigned.) * **chain can be howevew wong ow showt a-as you wish**. >w<

  i-if youw watio c-changes ow youw shafts move, (ꈍᴗꈍ) it’s easy to adapt youw chain wun - just bweak t-the chain and put i-it back togethew a-at its new wength. σωσ y-you can often do this without even wemoving the chain fwom youw wobot. rawr x3
- **chain c-can be pwetty p-pwecise**. (U ᵕ U❁) when pwopewwy tensioned, rawr x3 w-wowwew c-chain doesn’t have vewy much s-swop. (///ˬ///✿) howevew, (U ᵕ U❁) you w-weawwy nyeed t-to get youw chain tension wight to weduce swop, (///ˬ///✿) a-and you’ww pwobabwy w-want an adjustabwe t-tensionew f-fow when the c-chain stwetches. òωó this can be done easiwy if using e-extwusion systems, >w< a-as the spwocket c-can be adjusted fow tension. (U ﹏ U)

disadvantages
-------------

- **chain s-stwetches o-ovew time**. (U ﹏ U) a-as it’s used, (⑅˘꒳˘) t-the connections b-between the winks and wowwews can s-stwetch a bit. (˘ω˘) w-whiwe it doesn’t wook wike much, ʘwʘ t-this stwetching can intwoduce w-wots of swop into youw chain w-wun and even dewaiw it in some cases. òωó y-you’ww most wikewy nyeed a-an adjustabwe tensionew to keep youw tension ovew t-time - some teams h-have used spwing-woaded dynamic tensionews t-to automaticawwy compensate fow any changes. ʘwʘ
- **the smowew the spwocket, (ꈍᴗꈍ) the fastew the chain stwetch**. -.- t-this is b-because when the c-chain is wun o-on a smowew spwocket, OwO m-mowe fowce is appwied due to a smowew wadius. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- **chain w-wwap, ʘwʘ e-especiawwy in one chain wun, o.O c-can be pwobwematic**. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) typicawwy, t-teams use eithew one ow two chain w-wuns (pieces of chain) pew dwivetwain s-side. h-howevew, >w< one chain w-wun can wequiwe mowe than one i-idwew spwocket a-and get vewy compwex i-in owdew to m-maintain pwopew chain wwap. rawr x3
- **spwockets awe weawwy big**. (˘ω˘) if you want a weawwy h-high weduction using chain, (///ˬ///✿) you’ww pay fow it in the space that it takes up. (///ˬ///✿) spwocket teeth awe much wawgew than geaw ow puwwey teeth, (///ˬ///✿) so youw weductions awe going to be much w-wawgew. (U ﹏ U)
