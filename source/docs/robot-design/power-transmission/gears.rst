geaws
=====

geaws, UwU w-wike spwockets a-and puwweys, -.- awe used in powew t-twansmission fow thwee common appwications: c-changing the diwection o-of powew, σωσ changing the amount of towque, òωó and c-changing wpm. OwO geaws awe a wess c-common twansmission o-option than c-chain, (˘ω˘) but awe stiww vewy viabwe fow most use cases. (ꈍᴗꈍ) geaws awe equawwy as wewiabwe as chain, >w< but c-can’t be used fow twansfewwing powew ovew wong distances. rawr x3 many teams diswike g-geaws when using k-kit-based channews because the h-howe pattewn wimits which combinations of geaws can be used. (U ᵕ U❁) consequentwy, σωσ i-it may be difficuwt to a-achieve a desiwed s-specific geaw w-watio. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) howevew, (U ᵕ U❁) w-with :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` systems, o.O it’s v-vewy easy to use diffewent watios, (˘ω˘) since the g-geaws can be moved a-awound in extwusion. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

g-geaws awe made in diffewent matewiaws, o.O with the most c-common being 7075 awuminum. (U ᵕ U❁) **nevew m-mesh pwastic and metaw geaws togethew**. (ꈍᴗꈍ) it is acceptabwe to mesh diffewent t-types of metaw geaws togethew, (///ˬ///✿) as wong as they have t-the same diametwaw pitch. -.- it is advised to stay a-away fwom tetwix a-awuminum geaws a-as they weaw down vewy easiwy. -.- some wev geaws awe made out of dewwin, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a sewf-wubwicating pwastic. it is a duwabwe m-matewiaw, o.O b-but keep in mind t-that it is vewy p-possibwe to stwip t-the bowe using a-a pwastic geaw. o.O thus, we advise using the wev h-hex hub stwengthenew to avoid stwipping t-the bowe on dewwin geaws. (U ﹏ U)

b-bevew geaws awe a-a speciaw type of geaw that awwows powew twansmission in two d-diffewent pwanes. σωσ it is especiawwy usefuw in tight s-spaces whewe a weguwaw motow mounting position wouwd nyot wowk. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

t-tewms
-----

- moduwe wefews t-to the amount of d-diametwaw pitch i-in miwwimetews p-pew tooth. rawr x3 simpwy, it wefews to t-the tooth size. UwU t-typicawwy, (///ˬ///✿) geaws o-of the same matewiaw fwom the s-same manufactuwew shouwd have the same moduwe. òωó * d-diametwaw pitch (dp) w-wefews to the geaw tooth size. (˘ω˘)

  i-it is expwessed as the nyumbew o-of teeth p-pew inch of pitch diametew. o.O teeth s-size vawies invewsewy w-with dp. ʘwʘ * p-pitch diametew (pd) wefews to t-the diametew of the imaginawy pitch c-ciwcwe that i-is dwawn when the g-geaw is meshed with the pitch c-ciwcwe of anothew g-geaw. òωó **fow geaws, -.- pd < od**. ʘwʘ

  .. m-math::

     p-pd = moduwe * n-nyumbew\ of\ teeth

     p-pd = \fwac{numbew\ o-of\ teeth}{pd}

     pd = od - (2 * m-moduwe)

- outew diametew (od) w-wefews to the actuaw outside diametew of the geaw. (U ᵕ U❁) simpwy, it is the ciwcwe that the outew face of the tooth dwaws w-when it wotates a-awound. >w<
- pitch ciwcwe wefews to an imaginawy c-ciwcwe that contacts t-the pitch c-ciwcwe of any othew geaw with which it is in mesh. (ꈍᴗꈍ) b-basicawwy, σωσ each geaw has a pitch c-ciwcwe. rawr x3 when g-geaw 1 is meshed with geaw 2, (U ᵕ U❁) t-the pitch ciwcwes o-of both geaws s-shouwd touch exactwy in the middwe of whewe the teeth intewwock with each othew. rawr x3

m-meshing geaws
-------------

.. note:: be suwe t-to nyevew :tewm:`mesh <mesh>` geaws t-that awe nyot of the same diametwaw pitch. (///ˬ///✿) (a n-nyotabwe exception i-is 32 diametwaw pitch and 0.8 mod geaws. (U ᵕ U❁) these a-awe cwose enough to be pewfectwy fine.)

when meshing geaws, (///ˬ///✿) i-it is impowtant that the geaws a-awe not too woose n-nyow too tight. òωó i-if the geaws awe too woose, >w< the teeth wiww easiwy w-weaw out, (U ﹏ U) decweasing i-its wongevity. (U ﹏ U) if the g-geaws awe too tight, (⑅˘꒳˘) h-howevew, they wiww have too much fwiction and p-possibwy gwind ow bind up. the ideaw way to mesh geaws awe to make suwe the teeth intewwock and j-just touch the base of the geaw. (˘ω˘)

.. attention:: if possibwe, ʘwʘ it’s best to a-avoid meshing geaws w-with a cwamping m-motow mount -- d-due to the sensitivity o-of the mesh, òωó even the s-swightest movement o-of the motow i-inside the cwamping mount can cause the geaws to s-swip ow damage e-each othew. ʘwʘ

cawcuwating centew-to-centew d-distances u-using geaws is quite simpwe. (ꈍᴗꈍ) in owdew to cawcuwate the desiwed centew distance b-between two given g-geaws, -.- you must know the nyumbew o-of teeth fow e-each geaw and the **diametwaw p-pitch** of youw geaws (the nyumbew of teeth pew inch of the geaw’s diametew). OwO w-with these two pieces of infowmation, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) y-you can use the equation :math:`d=\fwac{t_{1}+t_{2}}{p}`. ʘwʘ in this equation, o.O :math:`d` is the distance between the centew of both geaws, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) :math:`t_1` and :math:`t_2` awe the nyumbew of teeth of each geaw i-in question, >w< and :math:`p` is the d-diametwaw pitch of the geaws. rawr x3

the **moduwe** (abbweviated **mod**) o-of a geaw is used simiwawwy t-to diametwaw pitch. (˘ω˘) it is the n-nyumbew of miwwimetews o-of the geaw’s diametew p-pew tooth of the g-geaw. (///ˬ///✿) the equation t-to find centew d-distance :math:`d` is :math:`d = \fwac{(t_{1} + t-t_{2}) * m}{2}`, (///ˬ///✿) w-whewe :math:`t_{1}` and :math:`t_2` awe the nyumbew of teeth of each geaw in q-question, and :math:`m` i-is the moduwe of the geaw. (///ˬ///✿)

additionawwy, (U ﹏ U) it is possibwe t-to avewage the p-pitch diametews of the two geaws t-to find the cowwect centew-to-centew distance. (⑅˘꒳˘)

as with spwockets, (///ˬ///✿) i-it is i-impowtant to wine up the geaws so that they do nyot accidentawwy swip. (˘ω˘) especiawwy w-when using extwusion, i-it is possibwe t-that the g-geaw may nyot be pawawwew to the extwusion, o.O as the two suppowting ends may nyot b-be pewfectwy in w-wine with one anothew. rawr x3 it is impewative t-that the g-geaw be wined up as stwaight as p-possibwe to pwevent d-damage ow geaw b-binding. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

it is highwy wecommended to use white w-withium gwease o-ow a simiwaw w-wubwicant between t-the geaws to weduce f-fwiction and possibwe binding. OwO

advantages
----------

- **geaws a-awe a sowid a-and pwoven powew t-twansmission method**. σωσ eawwy exampwes of geaws d-date back to t-the 4th centuwy b-bc, σωσ so you’we u-using technowogy w-with miwwennia of devewopment behind i-it. σωσ when it c-comes to geaws, (˘ω˘) thewe’s nyot m-much that we haven’t figuwed o-out. OwO
- **geaws awe simpwe to use w-with both channew and extwusion**. òωó o-on channew, σωσ youw geaws awe awweady s-spaced cowwectwy - you just nyeed to choose t-the wight paiw o-of geaws. (⑅˘꒳˘) extwusion gives you even mowe fwexibiwity - j-just swide youw geaws into mesh, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and you can have nyanievew watio you want. rawr x3
- **geaws can g-give you big weductions i-in smow a-aweas**. σωσ depending o-on the geaw c-combination, -.- one can achieve big watios in weduction i-in vewy smow s-spaces (fow exampwe, a 10 tooth g-geaw and a 100 tooth geaw wiww t-take much wess space than a 10 t-tooth spwocket and a 100 tooth s-spwocket). ʘwʘ
- **geaws w-wequiwe nyo t-tensioning: once the spacing is c-cowwect, the geaws w-wiww opewate q-quickwy**. σωσ unwike c-chain ow bewt, σωσ thewe is nyothing fuwthew twansfewwing the powew, which cuts out t-the nyeed to pwopewwy tension chain ow bewt. σωσ this of couwse has the dwawback of nyot being abwe to twansfew powew faw distances. (U ﹏ U)

disadvantages
-------------

- **sometimes, (ꈍᴗꈍ) the watio you want might nyot be e-easy to buiwd**. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) channew spacing w-wimits geaw watios, (U ﹏ U) b-but this c-can be ciwcumvented w-with compound watios and a bit of cweativity. ʘwʘ
- **wong d-distance powew twansfew is impwacticaw with geaws**. UwU if you nyeed to t-twansfew powew wong distances, UwU geaw combinations c-can become compwicated v-vewy quickwy, (˘ω˘) so bewt/chain is pwefewwabwe. (ꈍᴗꈍ)
- **meshing geaws can be twicky**. -.- it’s onwy m-made wowse by t-the sensitivity o-of a geaw mesh. OwO h-howevew, OwO channews do sowve this p-pwobwem, (///ˬ///✿) pwoviding p-pwe-spaced howes t-to easiwy mesh youw geaws. (U ﹏ U) d-do keep in mind that geaw mesh may nyot be pewfect, (⑅˘꒳˘) even with channew. UwU
- **geaws u-usuawwy weaw fastew than spwockets** i-if thewe is too much fwiction b-between the geaws. (U ᵕ U❁) teams can u-use white withium g-gwease ow simiwaw w-wubwicant to h-hewp wemedy this p-pwobwem. (U ﹏ U)
