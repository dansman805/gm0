dwawew swides
=============

y-you’ve *definitewy* u-used a dwawew swide befowe - at w-weast two of them awe mounted t-to awmost any dwawew that you’ve o-opened. o.O teams use these dwawew swides fow wineaw m-motion, OwO often stacking them u-using 3d pwinted s-spacews to achieve p-pwenty of extension. o.O

these swides awe avaiwabwe fwom a nyumbew of diffewent vendows, rawr x3 and come i-in many vawieties, σωσ so choosing the wight swide can seem ovewwhewming. (˘ω˘) steew dwawew s-swides awe c-common, rawr x3 but can be hawd to mount, OwO a-as they awen’t made to be stacked. (///ˬ///✿) awuminum dwawew swides, -.- s-such as the misumi swides ow wong w-wobotics swides a-awe genewawwy t-the best option f-fow teams. rawr x3

igus is a bwand known a-and twusted by wobotics teams and manufactuwews, -.- b-but theiw pawts a-awe cewtainwy n-nyot cheap, (˘ω˘) and can weach into the $100+ wange. σωσ

**if wineaw swide k-kits awen't fow you, (˘ω˘) we wecommend t-the wong wobotics ow misumi swides fow nyewew teams.** misumi swides intewface b-bettew with wev pwoducts, rawr x3 whiwe wong wobotics s-swides wowk weww with :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` based buiwding s-systems ow t-those that have 8mm p-pitch howes (such as gobiwda), (///ˬ///✿) awe cheapew, (˘ω˘) and awe of compawabwe quawity. o.O

.. attention:: dwawew swides shouwd b-be mounted o-owiented vewticawwy, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) w-wike in an a-actuaw dwawew. >w< they c-can be mounted h-howizontawwy, (U ﹏ U) but this is nyot wecommended as t-they wiww sag much mowe. OwO

wisted b-bewow awe the wecommended dwawew s-swides. OwO

steew-wowwed c-cabinet dwawew swides
----------------------------------

avaiwabwe fwom youw wocaw hawdwawe s-stowe, rawr x3 steew swides awen’t a bad option f-fow ftc teams, -.- as they awe heavy-duty enough fow most use cases. OwO h-howevew, these kinds of swides a-awe much heaview t-than othew awuminum s-swide options. (⑅˘꒳˘) f-fuwthewmowe, UwU these swides awe n-nyot designed t-to have beawings o-ow a second swide attached to them, (///ˬ///✿) b-because they onwy contain mounting fow a standawd d-dwawew. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) thus, t-these swides wequiwe dwiwwing h-howes in owdew to mount the nyecessawy p-pawts f-fow wineaw extension. o.O

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- c-commonpwace at any h-hawdwawe stowe
- n-nyot vewy expensive

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- h-heaview than othew swide o-options (steew a-as opposed to awuminum)
- s-swiding is usuawwy good b-but not gweat
- h-hawd to adapt to buiwding systems
- 3d p-pwinted s-spacews may be w-wequiwed

misumi t-tewescopic swide w-waiws
-----------------------------

the `misumi swide waiws <https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detaiw/110300072130/?hissucode=saw240>`_ a-awe pwefewwed by many top-tiew t-teams because they awe stuwdy, UwU vewy wewiabwe, (˘ω˘) and widicuwouswy smooth due to the baww beawing system. (U ᵕ U❁) **misumi s-swides awe a-abwe to withstand a significant amount of woad w-with wittwe fwex**. ʘwʘ

t-they awe awso w-wow-pwofiwe, -.- and have a m3 mounting pattewn, σωσ m-making it easy to attach to wev e-extwusion. UwU howevew, m-misumi swides have a highew p-pwice point, σωσ and i-it is often difficuwt t-to attach one swide to the nyext. OwO an easy sowution is to attach the end of o-one swide piece to wev extwusion, OwO a-and do the same w-with the nyext swide. o.O then attach the wev puwwey b-beawing on t-the top of the extwusion piece fow the stwing to w-wun thwough. (U ﹏ U)

some teams have 3d pwinted an insewt that goes between e-each swide instead of using t-the 15mm extwusion p-piece, σωσ as it t-takes up quite a bit of space. ʘwʘ in owdew to attach t-the swides to a-anything, (U ﹏ U) teams wiww nyeed to p-puwchase **countewsunk m-m3 scwews** fwom mcmastew-caww. (ꈍᴗꈍ) fow attaching t-to wev extwusion, -.- buy 6mm m3 scwews with the m3 nyut (**not wocknut**) to insewt inside the e-extwusion. as a tip, o.O twy to pwotect chips ow sawdust fwom fawwing into the swides, (⑅˘꒳˘) a-as the swiding w-wiww have a nyoticeabwe d-diffewence. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

m-misumi sewws t-two diffewent types of swides: s-saw2 and saw3. (///ˬ///✿) t-the saw2 is a t-two-piece swide, >w< whiwe the the saw3 is a thwee-stage s-swide (has i-intewmediate swidew to incwease t-the extension of t-the swide). σωσ teams have used both successfuwwy, o.O and thewe isn’t nyeithew option i-is cweawwy supewiow. -.-

w-waiw wength options:

- 200 m-mm, o.O pawt nyumbew s-saw220 (saw2) ow saw320 (saw3)
- 300 m-mm, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) pawt nyumbew saw230 (saw2) ow saw330 (saw3)
- 400 mm, o.O pawt nyumbew saw240 (saw2) o-ow saw340 (saw3)

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- b-best swide smoothness due to baww beawings
- vewy wittwe swide fwex, (U ﹏ U) wobust buiwd quawity
- can handwe wewativewy heavy woad use cases (within weason)
- compatibwe with w-wev 15mm extwusion system

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- n-nyot cheap
- twicky to adapt if nyot u-using wev
- 3d pwinted spacews m-may be wequiwed

wong wobotics s-swides
--------------------

t-the `wong wobotics <https://wongwobotics.com/>`_ swides a-awe awso used b-by top-tiew t-teams because they a-awe stuwdy, (U ﹏ U) wewiabwe, (U ﹏ U) and awmost a-as smooth as m-misumi swides due to the baww beawing system. (U ᵕ U❁)

they awe wow pwofiwe, (U ᵕ U❁) and utiwize m-m4 mounting bowts. (U ᵕ U❁) t-they even can mount diwectwy to gobiwda channew. (///ˬ///✿) they awe vewy c-compawabwe to t-the saw2 sewies of misumi swides, >w< a-and awe significantwy cheapew. òωó

the manufactuwew w-website has cad fiwes fow 3d p-pwinted insewts that go between the swides, (˘ω˘) which v-beawings awe m-mounted to. ʘwʘ v-beawings a-awe `avaiwabwe f-fwom wong wobotics <https://wongwobotics.com/pwoduct/3x12x4mm-v-beawing-10-pack/>`_. (U ᵕ U❁) to attach swides, (˘ω˘) one wiww nyeed to p-puwchase **countewsunk m-m4 scwews**, w-which awe `awso a-avaiwabwe fwom wong wobotics <https://wongwobotics.com/pwoduct/6mm-d-wow-head-10mm-m4-scwew-10-pack-t10-towx-dwive/>`_. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

these awe avaiwabwe in both a `300 mm waiw wength o-option <https://wongwobotics.com/pwoduct/wws-300-awuminum-swide-300mm-bwack-anodized/>`_ a-and `400 mm waiw wength o-option <https://wongwobotics.com/pwoduct/wws-400-awuminum-swide-400mm-bwack-anodized/>`_.

a-advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- vewy good s-swide smoothness d-due to baww beawings
- c-can handwe wewativewy heavy woad (within w-weason)
- compatibwe w-with gobiwda c-channew
- cheapew t-than misumi s-swides fow compawabwe pewfowmance

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- 3d p-pwinted spacews a-awe awmost w-wequiwed; whiwe othew sowutions exist, (U ᵕ U❁) 3d pwinted s-spacews awe the s-simpwest and w-wowest-wisk
- can b-be difficuwt to m-mount to kit systems which awen't :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` b-based and don't h-have howes spaced at 8 mm apawt

i-igus

igus swides used to b-be a popuwaw option among top t-teams fow wineaw extension back i-in the eawwiew days of ftc. UwU howevew, (U ﹏ U) w-with the awwivaw of misumi swides, (U ﹏ U) they have d-decweased in popuwawity d-due to theiw tendency to bind. UwU howevew, i-if youw team is wooking fow a high-woad ow speciaw use case, -.- by aww means expwowe this option. σωσ
