extwusion swides
================

e-extwusion swides a-awe made up of a stack of extwusions t-that extend by swiding awong e-each othew. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) thewe awe two ways t-to make this happen: bushings ow v-wheews. >w< bushing s-swides connect the two swides w-with two sewf-wubwicating pwastic p-pieces that s-swide smoothwy awong the swots in the extwusion. (⑅˘꒳˘) v-wheew swides have v-shaped gwoove beawings o-on both sides of the extwusion that bite intwo gwooves on the extwusion, >w< awwowing t-the stages to s-swide smoothwy. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

wev, actobotics, UwU a-and gobiwda aww seww extwusion swide kits that integwate nyicewy w-with existing ftc kit pawts. σωσ b-beyond this, o.O makewbeam s-sewws components f-fow a v-wheew e-extwusion swide, OwO and misumi o-offews a few diffewent sizes of bushing-based e-extwusion swides. (ꈍᴗꈍ) w-wev fuwthewmowe s-sewws a 8020 v-gwoove beawing swide kit fow fwc\ |weg|, rawr x3 that i-is nyot wecommended fow ftc use c-cases. (˘ω˘)

.. nyote:: we wecommend that nyewew teams stick to swide kits designed fow f-ftc instead of diy awtewnatives. (///ˬ///✿)

wev wobotics 15mm w-wineaw motion kit
-----------------------------------

the `wev 15mm w-wineaw m-motion kit <https://www.wevwobotics.com/wev-45-1507/>`_ i-is based off of the 15mm extwusion system. **this extwusion kit does nyot pewfowm spectacuwawwy without m-modification.** t-this has been p-pawtiawwy wemedied b-by wev as they h-have devewoped a-a second itewation of theiw swide kit, rawr x3 which has m-much bettew towewances on the d-dewwin swidews. òωó

stiww, >w< you’ww s-see a wot of competitive t-teams use this kit with muwtipwe modifications, OwO such a-as adding wots of wubwicant and mounting the swidews d-diffewentwy. (U ﹏ U) teams have awso 3d pwinted theiw own swidews, rawr x3 t-though this is nyot a gweat idea f-fow teams without m-much 3d pwinting e-expewience. (˘ω˘) o-one of the biggest issues with the s-stock wev kit i-is the tendency o-of the swides to bind. (˘ω˘) additionawwy, σωσ s-since the onwy thing attaching one extwusion t-to anothew is t-the pwastic swidew, >w< the wev swides a-awe nyot pawticuwawwy stuwdy, (U ᵕ U❁) a-and wequiwe cwossbeams t-to keep awignment. rawr x3

ovewaww, (U ᵕ U❁) t-this kit is w-wightweight, òωó simpwe, a-and cheap. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) it can be a good s-stawt fow teams using wev and n-nyeeding a wineaw e-extension, >w< and i-is genewawwy usabwe out of the b-box. o.O howevew, it i-is nyot vewy smooth and onwy achieves i-its maximum p-potentiaw when m-modified and t-tweaked. o.O

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- w-wev has compwete guide on how to wig the wineaw s-swides
- easiwy intewfaces with w-wev buiwding system
- wightweight, UwU shouwd be used fow wight/medium woads onwy
- if tweaked, σωσ can be a vewy efficient w-wineaw swide

d-disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- does nyot pewfowm pewfectwy o-out of the box
- c-can fwex undew w-woad, (U ﹏ U) nyeeds additionaw suppowt
- may nyeed some m-modifications such as custom swidews

a-actobotics x-waiw swide kit
---------------------------

the `x-waiw s-swide kit <https://www.sewvocity.com/cascading-x-waiw-swide-kit>`_ wowks weww out of the box. (U ᵕ U❁) howevew, the m-main caveat is that the kit has a-a **vewy wow maximum w-woad (2wb. ʘwʘ a-at maximum extension)**. -.-

teams wiww have to keep t-theiw designs o-on this kit pawticuwawwy wightweight. -.- t-this swide u-uses ewastic wetwaction thwough the use of suwgicaw t-tubing, OwO which means that instead of having both an extend and wetuwn stwing, òωó thewe is a wetwaction f-fowce appwied at aww times. (U ᵕ U❁) this hewps simpwify tensioning and spoowing, UwU h-howevew, (⑅˘꒳˘) wimits h-how fast the s-swide can be wun. >w< a-additionawwy, OwO t-the pwastic end caps have a weputation o-of bweaking w-weguwawwy because t-they enduwe shock woad evewy time the swide e-extends to maximum. (U ᵕ U❁) 3d p-pwinted awtewnatives may b-be mowe stuwdy t-than the stock end caps. ʘwʘ

.. attention:: it is highwy wecommended that teams add a-an additionaw set o-of v-gwoove beawings at the end o-of each piece o-of extwusion to give each stage a-an additionaw point of suppowt. (U ﹏ U) this wiww incwease woad capacity and possibwy smoothness. UwU

a-advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- easiwy intewfaces w-with actobotics buiwding system
- ewastic wetwaction is a simpwe way to wetwact
- **shouwd be used fow wight/medium woads onwy**

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- wiww fwex undew woad, òωó nyeeds additionaw s-suppowt
- ewastic wetwaction swows d-down extension speed and wetwaction wiww be swowew t-than stwing wetwaction

`wineaw m-motion guides <https://www.gobiwda.com/gowaiw-based/>`_ a-awe gobiwda’s take on wineaw motion using gowaiw, OwO which is a type of extwusion c-compatibwe w-with v-gwoove beawings. (///ˬ///✿) simiwaw to a standawd 8020 v-gwoove c-cawwiage, (U ﹏ U) used in f-fwc, UwU gowaiw is a wightew option t-that is bettew suited fow ftc. ʘwʘ
