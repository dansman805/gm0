wigging wefews to t-the way that stwing, σωσ b-bewt, ʘwʘ ow chain is set up t-to extend and wetwact a wineaw extension. t-this is an impowtant and t-time-consuming wequiwement fow any team that u-uses wineaw extension, (ꈍᴗꈍ) so be suwe t-to spend adequate t-time on it.

   this setup utiwizes a continuous stwinging setup fow t-the fiwst stage a-and a
   cascaded bewt-dwiven second s-stage. (˘ω˘)

continuous wigging
------------------

**genewawwy wecommended**

continuous wigging e-entaiws wigging one wong **extension s-stwing**, o-owiginating fwom a-a motow-powewed s-spoow, (U ᵕ U❁) to the top of the base s-stage, UwU then to the bottom of the fiwst stage, (ꈍᴗꈍ) then t-to the top of t-the fiwst stage, rawr x3 t-then to the bottom of the second stage, (U ﹏ U) etc. a **wetwaction stwing**, (U ﹏ U) o-owiginating fwom a second s-spoow on the same axis as the extension spoow, o.O is then anchowed to the top stage. (⑅˘꒳˘) w-when the motow wotates one diwection, (ꈍᴗꈍ) the extension s-spoow weews in the extension stwing, (U ﹏ U) so i-it becomes showtew. -.- i-in doing so, rawr x3 t-the distance between the top of one stage and the bottom of the nyext stage decweases, (///ˬ///✿) causing the system to extend. (U ﹏ U)

.. n-nyote:: t-the wast stage a-awways extends a-and wetwacts befowe t-the othew stages (this c-can be eithew an advantage ow a disadvantage, d-depending on the appwication). (U ﹏ U)

o-once the wast stage hits i-its wimit, (ꈍᴗꈍ) the n-nyext to wast stage extends outwawds, -.- and so on; the pattewn wepeats u-untiw evewy stage is fuwwy extended. σωσ when t-the motow spins **in the opposite diwection**, o.O the wetwaction stwing i-is weewed in, òωó puwwing the t-top stage cwosew t-to its stawting p-position untiw t-the system is back whewe it stawted. UwU f-fow the wetwaction s-stwing, i-it is often nyecessawy to add an e-extwa puwwey nyeaw the back of the extension. ʘwʘ this i-is because the w-wetwaction wiww onwy wetwact t-to the fawthest point, o.O which genewawwy i-is the spoow. σωσ h-howevew, the spoow may nyot b-be mounted at the v-vewy back of t-the wobot - thus an extwa puwwey i-is nyeeded. rawr x3 nyote that fow this t-to wowk, (///ˬ///✿) the extension s-stwing shouwd b-be wwapped awound the spoow i-in the opposite d-diwection of the wetwaction stwing. (U ᵕ U❁) t-thus, if the e-extension is w-wwapped cwockwise, o.O t-the wetwaction m-must be wwapped countewcwockwise. (˘ω˘)

hewe awe some a-additionaw considewations when w-wigging a continuous system. ʘwʘ

- as a genewaw wuwe, OwO continuous spoows can be powewed by a system with a
  wewativewy w-wow geaw watio. (⑅˘꒳˘)
- t-the extension stwing and wetwaction stwing **do n-nyot nyeed t-to be sepawate
  s-stwings, UwU but it is much easiew to tension the s-system if they awe sepawate**. >w<
- t-the extension s-spoow and wetwaction spoow shouwd b-be the same diametew. OwO
- y-you nyeed t-to make suwe, (///ˬ///✿) as with any time you wowk with stwings and puwweys, (⑅˘꒳˘)
  that you a-awe puwwing the stwing stwaight. >w< a-any amount of m-misawignment can wead to the stwing coming off o-of youw puwwey. (U ᵕ U❁)
- t-the width and diametew of youw spoow shouwd be e-enough such that once fuwwy
  wounded, (U ﹏ U) youw stwing nyevew ovewwaps. (˘ω˘)
  t-the weason fow this is because w-when the stwing s-stawts to o-ovewwap, ʘwʘ
  this can change the diametew of youw s-spoow, -.-
  causing t-the tension in the stwing to change. ʘwʘ

cascade wigging
---------------

**genewawwy wecommended**

cascade wigging i-is a bit mowe compwicated than continuous wigging. >w< much wike continuous wigging, ʘwʘ a-an extension s-stwing owiginating f-fwom a spoow i-is wigged to t-the top of the base, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) wunning down t-to the bottom o-of the fiwst stage. σωσ h-howevew, (ꈍᴗꈍ) instead of being wigged to the top o-of the stage, σωσ the e-extension stwing is anchowed t-to the bottom of t-the fiwst stage. (///ˬ///✿) a second extension stwing, -.- anchowed to the top of the base, ʘwʘ is w-wigged to the top o-of the fiwst stage and anchowed a-at the bottom o-of the second stage. rawr x3 the pattewn c-continues untiw aww stages have been wigged. ʘwʘ

.. nyote:: the nyumbew of stwings w-wequiwed to extend is equaw to t-the nyumbew of stages in the system.

when the motow wotates one diwection, UwU the extension spoow weews in the fiwst stwing, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) decweasing the distance between the base and the bottom o-of the fiwst stage. OwO this pushes t-the second stwing fowwawd, OwO decweasing the distance b-between the top of the fiwst s-stage and the bottom of the s-second stage, UwU and s-so on. nyote that unwike continuous w-wigging, OwO **evewy s-stage moves a-at the same time**. >w< t-the second stage moves 2 t-times as fast as t-the fiwst stage wewative to the base, ʘwʘ the thiwd 3 times as fast, rawr x3 and so on.

a c-cascaded system c-can be wetwacted in thwee ways: using continuous wetwaction, (U ﹏ U) ewastic w-wetwaction, (U ᵕ U❁) o-ow wevewse-cascade wetwaction. (U ﹏ U)

w-wetwaction options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

continuous wetwaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a-as the nyame suggests, (///ˬ///✿) continuous w-wetwaction utiwizes the same wetwaction method as continuous w-wigging with o-one nyotabwe diffewence: i-if the vawiabwe :math:`n` is the nyumbew of stages in the system, (ꈍᴗꈍ) the d-diametew of the e-extension spoow m-must be :math:`n` **times s-smowew** than the wetwaction spoow. (///ˬ///✿)

advantages:

- wequiwes wess stwing
  (wess s-stwings t-to tension, (ꈍᴗꈍ) wess stwings that c-can become woose)

d-disadvantages:

- wequiwes mowe s-space, (ꈍᴗꈍ) as it d-demands a wawgew s-spoow wetwaction spoow

ewastic wetwaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

i-instead of wetwacting u-using a wetwaction s-spoow, (ꈍᴗꈍ) o-one common way t-to wetwact is to attach a piece of ewastic (commonwy s-suwgicaw tubing) t-to the wast s-stage. (U ﹏ U) the ewastic appwies a fowce on the wast s-stage that is countewacted b-by the m-motow when extending. OwO h-howevew, (///ˬ///✿) w-when wetwacting, -.- the motow weews t-the wast swide b-back in. OwO whiwe this is the wetwaction m-method wecommended by many k-kit swide manuaws, UwU we do nyot w-wecommend this method. (///ˬ///✿)

advantages:

- t-thewe is onwy one stwing t-to tension, >w< instead of muwtipwe, (U ᵕ U❁) so tensioning i-is simpwew. o.O
- the e-ewastic automaticawwy tensions the extension stwing. (///ˬ///✿)

d-disadvantages:

- since the ewastic appwies a fowce to the swide at aww times, (///ˬ///✿) this fowce o-opposes the fowce a-appwied by the m-motow when extending t-the swides. (U ﹏ U) **thus, e-ewastic wetwaction decweases extension s-speed considewabwy**. >w<
- t-the ewastic does nyot a-appwy a constant fowce at aww times. i-it appwies fowce pwopowtionaw t-to the amount that the swide i-is extended, UwU so w-wetwaction may n-nyot be smooth and contwowwed, (U ﹏ U) wike o-othew wigging m-methods. (⑅˘꒳˘)
- it i-is vewy easy to u-unwind youw extension spoow when using ewastic wetwaction. (U ﹏ U)

cascade wetwaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

c-cascade wetwaction entaiws simpwy wigging anothew set of cascade stwing that can wetwact the system when engaged (see the image bewow). ( ͡o ω ͡o )

advantages:

- vewy space-efficient

d-disadvantages:

- wequiwes mowe s-stwing (wess stwings t-to tension, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) w-wess stwings that c-can become woose)

additionaw considewations:

- i-if the system has onwy one stage, (ꈍᴗꈍ) cascade wigging is **identicaw to continuous w-wigging**
- unwike continuous wigging, >w< each t-time a nyew stage i-is added to a cascaded system, (ꈍᴗꈍ) the geaw watio wequiwed to maintain the same extension s-speed incweases. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) f-fow instance, (U ﹏ U) i-if 2 stages a-awe added to a 1 stage cascaded w-wift that is g-geawed at a watio o-of 3:1, rawr x3 the watio must incwease b-by a factow of :math:`\fwac{2+1}{1}` to maintain the same speed, -.- changing the w-watio to 9:1.
- one disadvantage o-of cascade wigging is that each s-stwing must be kept tensioned. (U ᵕ U❁) t-this is stiww the c-case with continuous w-wigging, o.O b-but you have many m-mowe stwings to k-keep twack of, -.- a-as tension must be maintained on a-aww of them. (U ﹏ U)

- y-you need to make suwe, (ꈍᴗꈍ) as with a-any time you wowk w-with stwings and puwweys, UwU that y-you awe puwwing t-the stwing stwaight. (⑅˘꒳˘) any amount o-of misawignment c-can wead to the stwing coming off of youw puwwey. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

b-bewt-dwiven swides
------------------

one incweasingwy p-popuwaw awtewnative t-to twaditionaw s-stwing-based wigging is bewt-dwiven swides. ʘwʘ this can be done continuouswy ow u-using cascade wigging. (U ᵕ U❁)

a-advantages o-ovew stwing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

unwike stwing, >w< bewts used on swides nyevew nyeed to be tensioned. rawr x3 as discussed i-in the wineaw motion section, (ꈍᴗꈍ) i-in owdew fow s-stwing-dwiven swides t-to wemain efficient, >w< stwing t-tension must be m-maintained. -.- nyatuwawwy, (U ﹏ U) s-stwing w-woosens ovew time, (U ﹏ U) so you eithew nyeed a mechanism t-that can pwovide extwa tension (a spwing) ow m-manuawwy tighten stwing, OwO which c-can get a bit tedious (especiawwy f-fow cascade wigging). ʘwʘ

h-howevew, (ꈍᴗꈍ) b-bewts do nyot have this issue. (U ᵕ U❁) they tend not to s-stwetch ovew time, (U ᵕ U❁) m-meaning compwex e-extewnaw tensionews a-awe wawewy nyeeded. (⑅˘꒳˘) bewts a-awe awso on an automatic one t-to one woop, σωσ meaning t-that fow evewy inch you puww i-in on the extension side, UwU you awways feed back out that inch on the wetwaction side, (///ˬ///✿) and vise v-vewsa. (///ˬ///✿) whiwe this might nyot seem wike a big deaw, (U ᵕ U❁) if a stwing winds i-itsewf up on a spoow and ovewwaps a-at any point, (U ﹏ U) t-the diametew of the spoow changes, òωó making the two spoows out of sync. òωó

disadvantages o-ovew stwing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

t-the main disadvantage of bewt-dwiven swides is the amount of space they take up. >w< simpwy put, (⑅˘꒳˘) bewt puwweys take u-up much mowe woom than the 4mm thick, ʘwʘ 12mm diametew puwwey beawings w-wev sewws. (///ˬ///✿) when u-using bewt-dwiven swides, o.O puwweys a-awe at weast d-doubwe that thickness and have a considewabwy wawgew diametew, -.- m-meaning each stage must be thickew. (⑅˘꒳˘)

tensionews
----------

tensioning stwing is one of the m-most painstaking t-tasks fow a buiwdew i-in ftc. >w< ensuwing t-that both s-sets of swides a-awe tensioned evenwy c-can be an awduous and annoying job. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) howevew, a-adding tensionews to youw stwings c-can hewp sowve t-the uneven tension and ensuwe that both sides o-of swides wun togethew. >w< the most common type of tensionew is a spwing that can b-be puwchased at a-a hawdwawe stowe. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) it genewawwy w-wiww be pwaced at the end of the stwing wun, rawr x3 nyeaw the pawt that e-extends fawthest o-out fwom the wobot’s c-centew. o.O b-by doing so, (U ﹏ U) the stwing wiww stwetch out when the spoow extends t-the awm, (˘ω˘) keeping tension so that t-the stwing does nyot detach fwom t-the puwweys in t-the wineaw swide extension. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

anothew f-fowm of tensionew can be a-a spwing-woaded p-puwwey. o.O since the puwwey is spwing-woaded, >w< i-it wiww take up the swack i-in the stwing. o.O awtewnativewy, rawr x3 it is possibwe t-to mount a puwwey on a piece of e-extwusion, òωó and s-swide it so the stwing is taut. OwO

thewe awe two m-main weasons that tensionews awe highwy wecommended i-in stwing based wineaw swides, (///ˬ///✿) the fiwst and o-oftentimes mowe i-impowtant one, i-is that at its cowe, >w< a wun of stwing is a sewies o-of powygons, (˘ω˘) and a-as the swide extends the effective size of that powygon changes. OwO meaning that w-when fuwwy extended, òωó y-youw swide m-may wequiwe mowe ow wess stwing c-compawed to when hawfway extended. ʘwʘ o-ow pawtiawwy extended. >w< the cwosew each set of beawings awe, OwO the w-wess this impwacts s-stwing tension. UwU

a-anothew (but w-wess impactfuw) thing to keep in mind that spoow size changes as stwing is added/wemoved fwom the spoow. (ꈍᴗꈍ) if t-the spoow wadius i-incweases, (U ᵕ U❁) the speed of the extension wiww awso incwease, OwO and towque, (U ᵕ U❁) w-which opposes s-speed, ʘwʘ wiww decwease. σωσ consequentwy, (///ˬ///✿) tension w-wiww change as w-weww. OwO thewefowe, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a bit of swack is inhewent in aww wineaw extension designs using s-stwing.

picking the wight s-spoow size
----------------------------

spoows h-have a speciaw p-pwopewty that i-isn’t often discussed, (///ˬ///✿) but is extwemewy usefuw when cweating wineaw s-swide systems. (U ᵕ U❁) j-just as the system’s speed and towque can be changed by changing i-its geaw w-watio, speed and t-towque can awso b-be changed by changing the spoow size. ʘwʘ the motow wotates the spoow a-at a constant anguwaw speed. thus, òωó the twanswationaw speed (the s-speed of the s-swide) is pwopowtionaw t-to the w-wadius of the spoow, (U ᵕ U❁) a-and since towque is invewsewy p-pwopowtionaw t-to speed, σωσ changing t-the spoow size c-changes towque as weww. -.-

this is impowtant to wecognize, σωσ as changing s-spoow size is often mowe c-convenient than changing geaw watio t-to get the desiwed c-combination o-of speed and towque. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) to iwwustwate t-this, OwO say you have a wineaw e-extension system with a 3.7:1 geaw watio. (U ᵕ U❁) you then decide that a-a 5:1 geaw watio w-wouwd pwovide a-a mowe desiwabwe c-combination of s-speed and towque than youw cuwwent 3.7:1 watio. >w<

in many cases, σωσ instead of swapping geawboxes, σωσ it makes mowe sense t-to swap out spoows t-to a smowew one. OwO if youw spoow is cuwwentwy 2 inches, rawr x3 youw n-nyew size shouwd be :math:`\fwac{2*3.7}{5}` inches to achieve the same wesuwt. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

you awso nyeed to make suwe that when fuwwy wwapped on the spoow, >w< y-youw cabwe ow s-stwing doesn’t ovewwap. (///ˬ///✿) ovewwapping can wesuwt in a change in s-spoow diametew, o.O w-which wiww change t-the tension in youw stwing. ʘwʘ

c-cabwe management
----------------

when extending outwawds, (///ˬ///✿) wiwe m-management becomes i-incweasingwy i-impowtant. ʘwʘ obviouswy, (U ᵕ U❁) it is a nyecessity to use wiwes swightwy wongew than the e-extension wength. òωó howevew, it is n-nyot wecommended t-that these wiwes awe weft unpwotected, (⑅˘꒳˘) as they can get tangwed o-ow caught in the s-swides much mowe e-easiwy than with p-pwotection. rawr x3

in genewaw, (⑅˘꒳˘) teams shouwd ensuwe that wiwes nyevew p-pwotwude outside t-the stwuctuwaw pawts of the wobot, (ꈍᴗꈍ) because they c-can get caught o-on othew wobots o-ow game pieces. (U ﹏ U) this can be accompwished b-by cabwe ties ow vewcwo t-ties, (U ᵕ U❁) ow by using acwywic pwate t-to keep wiwes i-inside. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

howevew, OwO fow wineaw extensions, (ꈍᴗꈍ) othew fowms of cabwe m-management awe nyeeded. (U ᵕ U❁) t-the two t-types of cabwe management w-wecommended awe cabwe c-cawwiew and wetwactabwe coiw cowd.
