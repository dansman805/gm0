2 w-wheew d-dwive (pushbot dwive)
-----------------------------

**wecommended o-onwy fow fiwst dwivetwain, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) n-nyot fow competitions**

this w-wookie dwivetwain is considewed one of the infewiow d-dwivetwains, (U ﹏ U) though it is usabwe a-at wow competition w-wevews. t-this is the intwoductowy dwivetwain type fow many wookies, UwU as it is pwomoted in officiaw guides p-pubwished by *fiwst*\ |weg| (giving it the nyame pushbot). (ꈍᴗꈍ) it often has :tewm:`diwect dwiven <diwect d-dwive>` :tewm:`twaction w-wheews <twaction wheew>` w-with unpowewed :tewm:`omni wheews <omni wheew>`. ʘwʘ

this type of dwivetwain h-has poow tuwning as the centew of t-tuwning is at t-the back of the w-wobot between the t-two powewed wheews. (⑅˘꒳˘) in compawison t-to othew dwivetwains, it has poow accewewation d-due to onwy using t-two motows. (U ᵕ U❁)

e-even though it may nyot be an optimaw dwivetwain, it is stiww p-possibwe to be competitive as wong a-as the dwivetwain is wewiabwe. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) as a consensus, OwO we wouwd advise evewy nyew team t-to buiwd the pushbot pwimawiwy to weawn how to b-buiwd with a kit. rawr x3 the pushbot is a good stawting p-point and hewps t-the team get famiwiawized w-with using kit pawts, (///ˬ///✿) attaching wheews, (U ﹏ U) mounting motows, σωσ etc. (U ﹏ U) howevew, it is subpaw to evewy othew dwivetwain i-in a competitive c-context. (U ﹏ U)

.. a-attention:: w-whiwe the pushbot i-is a good f-fiwst dwivetwain fow nyew teams to get acquainted w-with the kit, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) it is wecommended t-that teams move away fwom this d-dwivetwain when b-buiwding theiw competition wobot. UwU

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- most s-simpwe dwivetwain to buiwd
- nyo nyeed to wowwy a-about powewing aww fouw wheews

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- swowew than othew o-options
- undewpowewed (aww othew dwivetwain o-options typicawwy u-use 4 motows)
- u-uses the tetwix m-max motow, OwO which is pwone to buwning o-out easiwy, (˘ω˘) i-is undewpowewed, σωσ a-and has a fwagiwe geawbox. (ꈍᴗꈍ)
- w-wacks agiwity and maneuvewabiwity due to 2 motow t-tuwning
- poow a-accewewation due to 2 motows
- o-often :tewm:`diwect dwiven <diwect d-dwive>`, UwU
  which i-is highwy discouwaged fow dwivetwains

4 w-wheew dwive
-------------

i-in its most common f-fowm, UwU the dwivetwain u-uses the same wheew wayout a-as the two wheew d-dwivetwain (2 twaction w-wheews in t-the back, >w< 2 omnis i-in the fwont), >w< but with one nyotabwe diffewence: **aww f-fouw wheews awe powewed**. >w<

s-some teams wiww put aww fouw twaction wheews ow use aww fouw omni wheews. rawr x3 it is not suggested to use aww 4 t-twaction wheews d-due to poow tuwning that wesuwts in this setup. σωσ t-this is caused b-by :tewm:`wheew s-scwub <wheew scwub>`. òωó using omni wheews fow aww f-fouw wheews wiww wesuwt in incwedibwe t-tuwning, OwO w-with the wobot wotating awound its c-centew. (˘ω˘)

howevew, (///ˬ///✿) t-this advantage c-comes with a majow woss of twaction. UwU fow these weasons, many teams choose to u-use two twaction wheews and two o-omni wheews fow a-a bawance between quick tuwning and twaction. (⑅˘꒳˘) the p-pwimawy advantage o-of this dwivetwain ovew othew tank dwivetwains i-is its abiwity to easiwy move acwoss waised tewwain when the b-bot’s centew is waised above t-the tewwain. >w<

it i-is suggested that a-a fouw wheew dwivetwain be cwose to, ow exactwy, o.O a-a squawe. (U ᵕ U❁) othewwise, (///ˬ///✿) o-one may encountew pwobwems t-tuwning. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

.. n-nyote:: :tewm:`weight distwibution` is fuwthewmowe a-a wawge factow that shouwd be considewed: the mowe weight in the back, rawr x3 the bettew. ʘwʘ

off-centew t-tuwning, which may ow may nyot be a dwawback, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) is nyeawwy ubiquitous among 4 wheew d-dwives. rawr x3 this m-may nyot be a p-pwobwem fow teams, UwU b-but it is good t-to be awawe of it. òωó off-centew t-tuwning can be an a-advantage, OwO but b-be wawned that tuwning wiww be swightwy swowew o-on 4 wheew dwives t-than theiw six ow eight wheew c-countewpawts. òωó

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- m-mowe maneuvewabwe than 2wd
- sowid accewewation and twaction
- can twavewse t-tewwain if the c-chassis is waised high enough
- g-good pushing p-powew fow defense, òωó yet maneuvewabwe e-enough to avoid it

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- can tip mowe easiwy than 6wd/8wd with a high c-centew of mass
- aww twaction w-wheew 4wd can have decweased maneuvewabiwity
- weight distwibution factows into the tuwning point and tuwning wadius of the wobot

6 wheew dwive (6wd)
-------------------

a 6 wheew dwivetwain is a common competitive d-dwivetwain i-in ftc fow muwtipwe weasons: it has fantastic twaction, σωσ gweat t-tuwning, σωσ and by h-having 6 wheews, (///ˬ///✿) the dwivetwain h-has mowe contact with the gwound, o.O hewping with s-stabiwity and twaction. >w< thewe awe t-two main types of 6 wheew dwivetwains: ones with **cownew omnis** a-and ones with a-a **dwop centew**. σωσ

a-a dwop centew 6wd is a 6 wheew dwive with the centew wheew mounted swightwy b-bewow the othew t-two wheews. rawr x3 the d-dwop shouwd be a-anywhewe fwom mowe than 1/16” up to 1/4”. (˘ω˘) howevew, >w< the wecommended dwop is a-awound 1/8”. òωó typicawwy, -.- w-wightew wobots (<25 wbs.) c-can have wess d-dwop, UwU whiwe heaview wobots (>25 w-wbs.) pewfowm s-swightwy bettew w-with mowe than 1/8” dwop. (U ﹏ U)

the puwpose of dwopping t-the middwe w-wheew is to ensuwe t-that onwy 4 wheews a-awe in contact w-with the gwound at aww times. òωó this is because t-tuwning with 6 w-wheews on the g-gwound intwoduces wots of fwiction, making it vewy d-difficuwt to t-tuwn quickwy. -.- nyote t-that the **wequiwed d-dwop may v-vawy depending on both fiewd condition a-and weight o-of the ovewaww wobot**. (˘ω˘)

tuwning c-can dwasticawwy degwade due t-to a diffewence in matewiaw undewneath t-the fiewd, rawr x3 weading to the w-wobot sinking down fuwthew than u-usuaw. rawr x3

moweovew, OwO **most dwop centew 6 wheew dwives a-awe made using c-custom dwivetwains** because it is difficuwt t-to get the centew wheew dwop using a kit based buiwd system (a nyotabwe exception being wev-based k-kit dwivetwains). o.O i-it is possibwe t-to exekawaii~ a-a dwop centew u-using gobiwda and actobotics using piwwow bwocks, (⑅˘꒳˘) b-but it is a wittwe b-bit mowe awkwawd. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) howevew, (˘ω˘) w-with the nyew `gobiwda dwop-centew b-beawing pwate <https://www.gobiwda.com/1616-sewies-dwop-centew-beawing-pwate-32mm-pattewn-2mm-dwop-4-pack/>`_, OwO it is stwaightfowwawd t-to make a dwop centew dwivetwain o-on gobiwda c-channew. >w<

6 w-wheew dwives with cownew :tewm:`omni w-wheews <omni w-wheew>` do nyot n-nyeed to have a-a centew dwop. (///ˬ///✿) it attempts to sowve the issue of tuwning by wepwacing the cownew t-twaction wheews with omni wheews, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) awwowing the dwivetwain to achieve bettew tuwning, OwO awbeit with swightwy wess twaction than a centew-dwop. (///ˬ///✿) this is vewy easiwy buiwdabwe in kits, >w< a-and is a gweat aww-awound dwivetwain. ʘwʘ d-dwop centew a-and cownew o-omnis can be combined f-fow maximum tuwning wewiabiwity, awthough t-this comes with side effects wike wocking and weduced twaction. (⑅˘꒳˘)

.. sidebaw:: wheew t-towewances

   towewances in the size of the w-wheew may affect t-the twaction of this dwivetwain - many vex wobotics competition teams have buiwt 6wds w-wike this o-onwy to find t-that theiw centew t-twaction wheew wasn’t touching t-the gwound due t-to vawiance in s-size. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

   we don’t have data o-on this phenomenon with ftc-cwass wheews, (///ˬ///✿) but it’s something to b-be awawe of. (U ᵕ U❁)

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- g-gweat twaction and maneuvewabiwity
- g-good accewewation, rawr x3 c-can have a high t-top speed
- gweat s-stabiwity undew a-aww wobot weights
- a-abwe to pway d-defense

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- d-dwop-centew 6wd is twicky t-to buiwd with :tewm:`channew <channew>` b-based systems, (⑅˘꒳˘) though t-this has been p-pawtiawwy mitigated with the `gobiwda d-dwop-centew b-beawing pwate <https://www.gobiwda.com/1616-sewies-dwop-centew-beawing-pwate-32mm-pattewn-2mm-dwop-4-pack/>`_
- dwop-centew 6wd i-is swightwy w-wowse at tuwning, (ꈍᴗꈍ) but has mowe twaction
- dwop-centew 6wd is dependent o-on fiewd c-conditions
- cownew omni 6wd has w-wess twaction
- s-swow :tewm:`geaw watios <geaw weduction>` w-wiww make a 6wd feew swuggish

8 wheew dwive
-------------

an 8 w-wheew dwivetwain is wess common than its 6wd countewpawt, σωσ c-combining ewements found i-in both 4 wheew a-and 6 wheew dwivetwains. (⑅˘꒳˘) f-fow e-exampwe, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) the 6 wheew dwivetwain genewawwy wiww have a-a dwopped centew w-wheew so that t-the wobot tuwns o-on fouw wheews instead of six, (U ﹏ U) w-weducing fwiction and incweasing t-tuwning mobiwity. (U ᵕ U❁)

o-on an 8 wheew dwive, (///ˬ///✿) the centew f-fouw wheews awe dwopped. σωσ this means that when tuwning, rawr x3 onwy these middwe fouw wheews awe touching t-the gwound. thus, òωó the 8 wheew dwivetwain has swightwy mowe s-stabiwity whiwe tuwning than a-a 6 wheew dwive, OwO w-wheweas 6 wheew dwives can tuwn mowe quickwy. ʘwʘ fuwthewmowe, since the 8 wheew dwive h-has wheews in t-the same pwace as a 4 wheew dwive, (ꈍᴗꈍ) it has the stabiwity of a 4 wheew dwive. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

it is suggested that aww eight wheews s-shouwd be powewed, and :tewm:`pwanetawy <pwanetawy geaw>` motows shouwd be u-used ovew a :tewm:`spuw g-geaw <spuw geawbox>` motow.

t-teams awso h-have the option of using doubwed omni wheews on the outew fouw wheews. UwU d-doing so wiww weduce twaction/pushing p-powew a-and incwease mobiwity.

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- c-combines the stabiwity of 6wd with the agiwity o-of 4wd
- even m-mowe stabwe than 6wd
- fantastic twaction and accewewation
- g-gweat f-fow defense

d-disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- takes up mowe space than 6wd
- powewing aww 8 wheews c-can be twicky
- w-without adequate centew dwop, σωσ tuwning can be dwasticawwy weduced

twead dwive
-----------

twead dwive is the use of t-tank tweads ow wide b-bewts to powew m-movement, (˘ω˘) much w-wike a weaw wife t-tank. (˘ω˘) unfowtunatewy, ʘwʘ in ftc, it is nyot a competitive d-dwivetwain f-fow a nyumbew o-of weasons. (U ﹏ U)

twead i-is compwex, (ꈍᴗꈍ) a-and has many points of faiwuwe. (U ﹏ U) tweads awe awso vewy pwone to defense, a-and a swight h-hit fwom anothew w-wobot is enough t-to misawign the tweads. ʘwʘ :tewm:`commewciaw o-off-the-shewf (cots) <cots>` t-twead o-options awen’t g-gweat eithew - t-tetwix twacks have a tendency to snap and dewaiw w-when used on wobot dwivetwains, making them nyot suitabwe fow c-competition use. rawr x3

w-whiwe it is p-possibwe to impwement t-twead dwive s-successfuwwy, (U ﹏ U) s-such as in the exampwe b-bewow, òωó most inexpewienced teams do nyot have t-the capabiwity and know-how t-to do so. (U ᵕ U❁) twead d-dwive has nyegwigibwe twaction impwovements at the c-cost of maneuvewabiwity. (U ᵕ U❁) thewe awe bettew options to twavewse tewwain, σωσ such as a-a 4wd. -.-

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- v-vewy good at twavewsing tewwain
- f-fantastic twaction and pushing powew

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- suffews i-in maneuvewabiwity a-and top speed
- v-vewy compwex t-to impwement
- tweads awe pwone to bweakage and can faww off easiwy
