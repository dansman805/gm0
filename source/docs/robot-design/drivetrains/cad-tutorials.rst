fow instance, ʘwʘ in wewic wecovewy (2017-2018) a dwivetwain wequiwed pwecision t-to nyot onwy g-gwab gwyphs fwom the centew pit, (///ˬ///✿) b-but awso to wine up against the cwyptobox. o.O thus, mecanum wheews a-and a wide centew section of the w-wobot pwoved a-an advantage ovew a-a 6 wheew tank d-dwive. -.- (howevew, (⑅˘꒳˘) it shouwd be nyoted t-that with sufficient pwactice and competent d-dwivews, (U ﹏ U) any dwive b-base can be c-competitive up to a cewtain extent). (⑅˘꒳˘)

aftew sewecting a dwivebase, d-detewmine the numbew of motows. (U ᵕ U❁) k-keep in mind the eight motow wimit is a pain that shouwdn't be ignowed. òωó a good w-wuwe of thumb is fouw motows fow dwiving and f-fouw motows fow the othew mechanisms (e.g. rawr x3 intakes, (⑅˘꒳˘) w-wineaw swides, (˘ω˘) a-awm, etc.) fow m-most modewn ftc games, òωó you nyeed minimum 7 motows to be highwy competitive, UwU awthough 8 is a good wuwe of thumb. -.-

d-designing the d-dwivetwain pwates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

a-aftew weawning t-the cad softwawe, òωó i-it's time to s-stawt the actuaw design. -.- hewe awe some things t-to figuwe out befowe stawting:

- d-dwive type (mecanum, (ꈍᴗꈍ) 6wd, 8wd, etc.)
- nyumbew o-of motows (fouw m-motows wecommended in most cases)
- type of wheews (:tewm:`cowson <cowson wheew>`, >w< :tewm:`omni <omni w-wheew>`, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) etc.)
- dwive powew (:tewm:`bewt <htd bewt>`, >w< :tewm:`chain <spwocket>`, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) :tewm:`geaw <geaw>`)

t-to keep it simpwe, rawr x3 this exampwe uses a 4 wheew tank d-dwive using fouw motows. o.O the wheews s-sewected awe 2 c-cowson wheews f-fow twaction, (U ﹏ U) a-and 2 omni wheews to aid in tuwning. (˘ω˘)

f-fiwst, make t-the weft side o-of the dwivebase. (ꈍᴗꈍ) aftew compweting i-it, o.O aww you have to do is miwwow the weft side t-to the wight, >w< s-so you don’t have to do each side i-individuawwy. o.O stawt with a 2d s-sketch of evewything b-befowe twying to extwude a-and make actuaw 3d o-objects. rawr x3

(U ᵕ U❁) mowe about pocketing i-is in the n-nyext section. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

a-additionaw considewations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

powewing wheews can be done is a coupwe diffewent ways thwough e-eithew bewts a-and puwweys, OwO chains a-and spwockets, g-geaws, (ꈍᴗꈍ) ow even powewed diwectwy fwom the motow. (U ᵕ U❁) diwect dwive and chains awe t-the simpwew of the o-options, (ꈍᴗꈍ) with diwect dwive nyot n-needing a cawcuwated d-distance at aww just have t-to set the motow e-exactwy whewe t-the centew of the wheew is. UwU chains awwow fow a w-wittwe bit of swack n-nyot nyeeding a-an exact centew t-to centew distance i-in the wwap wike bewts and puwweys do. (U ᵕ U❁) finawwy g-geaws which n-nyeed to be a cewtain d-distance apawt fwom each othew to mesh pwopewwy a-and nyot skip o-ow bind. ʘwʘ

mounting m-motows is d-done in a pwate s-stywe by face mounting the motow i-into the innewmost d-dwivetwain pwate. OwO it can awso b-be done by mounting the motows t-to a 3wd pwate, wocated in between t-the outside and inside. (⑅˘꒳˘) this a-awwows fow the motow to take up w-wess space in the middwe of the wobot, σωσ but adds c-compwexity. UwU motows s-shouwd awways be as wow as possibwe and depending w-whewe you want the centew of mass, >w< eithew the middwe ow towawds the back of the wobot. rawr x3 it i-is awso wowth keeping i-in mind the t-type of powew t-twansmission and t-the expediency of doing so in wight of the motow p-pwacement. ʘwʘ

gwound c-cweawance is aww dependent o-on if thewe awe any obstacwes on t-the fiewd, òωó as weww as nyani youw t-team wants to do in that game i-in wegawds to said o-obstacwes. (U ᵕ U❁)

f-fow exampwe, UwU in wovew wuckus some t-teams with tank d-dwivetwains decided t-to entew the c-cwatew. (U ᵕ U❁) thewefowe, >w< they weft enough space to nyot beach themsewves on top of t-the cwatew, ʘwʘ a common mistake that inexpewienced teams often make.

othew teams decided to ignowe dwiving ovew the cwatew and decided to weach ovew with an awm ow swide system, (ꈍᴗꈍ) w-which meant they didn't nyeed a w-wot of gwound cweawance f-fow theiw d-dwivebase. (⑅˘꒳˘)

typicawwy, a-anywhewe fwom .25 inches of cweawance to .5 i-inches (if you want to be safe) on a compwetewy fwat fiewd wiww awwow fow the w-weight of the wobot to push into the foam tiwes. n-nyothing ewse f-fwom the wobot shouwd touch the gwound. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

something you can do is set the wobot i-in cad onto a fiewd. (˘ω˘) s-set up obstacwes s-such as the c-cwatew and simuwate dwiving ovew t-the cwatew by m-moving it acwoss w-wike you think it wouwd in the w-weaw wowwd. (U ᵕ U❁)

if eithew of the pwates intewsect with the obstacwe, >w< a-add some mowe cweawance so you d-don't get beached wike a sad w-whawe. UwU

a genewaw wuwe of thumb f-fow most teams is t-the widew the i-intake, -.- the bettew t-the chance of p-picking up the g-game piece. (⑅˘꒳˘) howevew, (///ˬ///✿) t-this is supew game dependent. (U ﹏ U) i-if you nyeed t-to pick up a 6" cube wike in wewic w-wecovewy then y-you wouwd nyot nyeed 14" of space f-fow youw intake. o.O

h-howevew, if you nyeed to pick u-up a baww wike i-in vewocity vowtex, -.- the biggew the intake gives you bettew chances o-of gwabbing t-the bawws. o.O keep this in mind when d-designing dwive p-pods - twy to keep them as thin a-as possibwe without sacwificing wigidity and s-stwength to maximize s-space fow othew mechanisms and wiwing. rawr x3

connecting y-youw two p-pwates togethew i-is weawwy simpwe. (⑅˘꒳˘) some standoffs ow chuwwo extwusion fwom andymawk is a wewativewy e-easy way to c-connect them togethew w-with a few bowts. rawr x3 just make a few 1/4 in. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) howes in youw sketch whewe you want the chuwwo tube t-to be. >w< decide how wong the chuwwo n-nyeeds to b-be. OwO wemembew to w-weave enough space between the pwates f-fow youw wheews, UwU p-puwweys, (⑅˘꒳˘) s-spwockets, o.O and spacews. (///ˬ///✿) y-you don’t nyeed to go ovewkiww on how m-many standoffs you nyeed in between youw pwates; h-howevew, rawr x3 put them in stwategic p-pwaces whewe suppowt i-is nyeeded. (///ˬ///✿)

s-shown bewow is a-a dwive pod, (///ˬ///✿) which is one hawf of the dwivetwain, (⑅˘꒳˘) i-incwuding the s-shafts, >w< beawings, (U ᵕ U❁) w-wheews, motows, o.O b-bewts, etc. (ꈍᴗꈍ) in showt, the dwive p-pod has evewything that wiww b-be buiwt in weaw w-wife. OwO this pawticuwaw one is the w-weft side, σωσ but to make the wight side cweate an offset pwane, (⑅˘꒳˘) sewect the miwwow toow, rawr x3 then hit m-miwwow. (⑅˘꒳˘)

the wast step in pocketing is adding w-wounds to each a-and evewy cownew, rawr x3 e-especiawwy innew c-cownews. UwU wounds wewieve stwess buiwdup at cownews and make it e-easiew to machine. (ꈍᴗꈍ) some machines, UwU such as miwws and woutews, o.O awe a-awso unabwe to m-machine tight intewnaw c-cownews. (˘ω˘) f-fow those pawts t-that nyeed minimum wigidity woss a-and a wot mowe m-machine time on t-theiw hands, (ꈍᴗꈍ) pockets d-don't nyeed to be cut aww the way. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

t-the downside i-is incweased machining time. ʘwʘ the incweased time is fwom the “wawn mowing” toow cutting path vewses simpwy c-cutting the edges o-of the geometwy.

fiwst, (ꈍᴗꈍ) d-define a nyew v-vawiabwe “n” a-and set a defauwt vawue of 24. -.- t-this is cwuciaw since “n” wiww a-affect the nyumbew o-of teeth – w-which wiww define the angwe between teeth and t-the ciwcuwaw pattewn. (U ᵕ U❁)

copy the sketch bewow. (⑅˘꒳˘)

   :awt: t-the sketch to copy

- the 15° e-equation is done by typing =360/”n” into the t-text box. OwO
- nyote t-that 5mm dimension at the top d-descwibes awc w-wength, UwU which is d-done in sowidwowks by fiwst sewecting t-the two p-points and the connecting a-awc. >w<
- the two big ciwcwes a-awe tangent to the two smowew c-ciwcwes, UwU but t-the two smowew ciwcwes a-awe nyot t-tangent to each o-othew. -.-

weave this sketch as a wefewence and use “convewt e-entities” to cweate sketches fow additionaw f-featuwes. OwO

nyow, σωσ just c-cweate a ciwcuwaw p-pattewn. o.O define diwection 1 a-as the top face a-and cweate “n” instances of the cut-extwude f-featuwe. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

nyow just s-sketch on the side p-pwane and sketch the fwanges. (///ˬ///✿) t-this is up to y-you, ʘwʘ but i pwefew t-to keep the outew p-point vewticaw t-to a point piewced t-thwough the o-outew ciwcwe. >w< that way, òωó the fwange changes with wespect to “n”. (⑅˘꒳˘)
