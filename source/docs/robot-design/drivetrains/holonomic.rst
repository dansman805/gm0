howonomic dwivetwains
=====================

m-mecanum d-dwive
-------------

mecanum d-dwivetwains consist of fouw mecanum w-wheews which awe powewed independentwy b-by one motow. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) this configuwation angwes t-the vewocity of each wheew, (U ﹏ U) a-awwowing the wobot t-to stwafe. (U ᵕ U❁)

the p-pwimawy advantage to mecanum dwive is the maneuvewabiwity it affowds, (///ˬ///✿) especiawwy because the w-wobot can stwafe instead of tuwn and dwive. the wowwews on mecanum wheews fowm a 45 d-degwee angwe w-with the wheew’s axis of wotation, σωσ w-which means that mecanum dwivetwains can’t stwafe as fast a-as they can dwive fowwawd. rawr x3

this c-can be expwained b-by discussing t-the fowces invowved. òωó w-when each wheew wotates, OwO i-it appwies a fwiction fowce to the gwound, ʘwʘ which m-moves the wobot. (ꈍᴗꈍ) w-when moving fowwawd, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) b-both sets of weft wheews wotate in the same diwection at t-the same speed, UwU and both sets of w-wight wheews wotate in the same diwection at the same speed, σωσ meaning that the fowces d-do nyot oppose each othew. (U ﹏ U) howevew, when stwafing, (///ˬ///✿) n-nyeithew the two weft wheews nyow the two w-wight wheews a-awe wotating at t-the same speed. (˘ω˘) in many cases, (˘ω˘) they even wotate in opposite diwections. ʘwʘ

these two opposing fowces cause the wowwews t-to swip mowe a-and mowe, (U ﹏ U) which a-angwes the wobot’s v-vewocity a-at the expense of t-twaction (mowe swipping wesuwts in a woss of speed). (ꈍᴗꈍ) h-howevew, (U ﹏ U) the wheews do stiww s-swip when moving fowwawd but n-nyot as dwasticawwy a-as they do when stwafing. ʘwʘ

this is the pwimawy disadvantage t-to mecanum dwivetwains: they tend not to have much p-pushing powew and thus, rawr x3 awe vuwnewabwe to defense by a stuwdy t-tank dwive. (U ﹏ U)

due to the fact that m-mecanum wheews a-awe mowe wikewy t-to swip because o-of the diagonaw wowwews, òωó an optionaw a-addition t-to mecanum dwives i-is a sepawate odometwy mechanism i-in owdew to twack the wobot’s wocation duwing a-autonomous. (U ᵕ U❁)

.. a-attention::

   it is impowtant t-to nyote that in owdew to maximize t-the efficiency a-and stabiwity of mecanum dwives, (U ᵕ U❁) w-when viewed f-fwom above, σωσ the w-wowwews of each wheew shouwd p-point towawds the centew of the w-wobot, -.- fowming an x-x shape, rawr x3 wathew t-than a whombus. o.O

   the pwimawy w-weason fow this i-is that it awwows the dwivetwain t-to tuwn significantwy f-fastew t-than it wouwd othewwise b-be abwe t-to. (˘ω˘) when using the suggested setup, OwO when viewed f-fwom the wobot’s undewside, σωσ the w-wowwews fowm a whombus. òωó this awwows the fowce appwied by the wheews on the gwound to act tangent to the tuwn wadius, (ꈍᴗꈍ) w-weading to f-fastew tuwning. o.O

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- fantastic m-maneuvewabiwity a-and agiwity d-due to stwafing, UwU can avoid defense vewy weww
- g-good accewewation, (ꈍᴗꈍ) can have high t-top speed
- vewy v-vewsatiwe dwivetwain fow nyeawwy a-any game

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- s-suffews i-in twaction, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) as mecanum wowwews have a wowew coefficient of fwiction than twaction w-wheews; cannot twavewse t-tewwain
- abwe to b-be pushed awound on defense
- wheews must be powewed i-independentwy, ʘwʘ s-so thewe is nyo wedundancy

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

thewe a-awe pwenty o-of mecanum wheews on the mawket, (⑅˘꒳˘) and it can be vewy d-daunting to c-choose between the many vendows. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a-an impowtant featuwe i-is the type of mechanism that faciwitates t-the motion, òωó eithew :tewm:`bushing <bushing>` ow :tewm:`beawing <baww beawing>`. ʘwʘ beawing based mecanum wheews often have supewiow s-stwafing because thewe is wess wesistance fow the wowwews to ovewcome. (ꈍᴗꈍ) anothew i-impowtant nyote i-is that some ftc t-teams invest in 6 i-inch mecanum w-wheews instead of 3 ow 4 inch mecanum w-wheews, òωó often a-at a much highew p-pwice. **it is highwy wecommended that teams s-stick with 3 ow 4 i-inch mecanum wheews**. (U ﹏ U) hewe i-is a genewaw wist o-of the mecanum options wanked in owdew of wecommendation. (˘ω˘)

1. `gobiwda mecanum wheews`_ ($105 w-with team discount): t-this wecent addition to the w-wineup has become o-one of the stwongest options f-fow its vawiety of positive attwibutes. (˘ω˘) gobiwda mecanum wheews awe based on the t-twied and tested nyexus beawing m-mecanum wheews, (///ˬ///✿) which means it has fantastic stwafing. (///ˬ///✿)

   they awe awso vewy wobustwy buiwt, UwU and awe significantwy mowe convenient to mount to ftc standawd buiwd systems. -.- thy h-have a buiwt in gobiwda 16mm and 32mm h-howe pattewn, >w< and has easy suppowt fow dead a-axwe. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

   you can mount hubs in w-wheews and gobiwda mecanum wheews c-can easiwy mount t-to 1/2" hex, rawr x3 3/8" hex, (⑅˘꒳˘) 12 mm w-wex, 6 mm d, rawr x3 1/4" d-d, o.O and many o-othew shafts. -.- hubs c-can awso be mounted inside the w-wheew fow vewy w-wow pwofiwe mounting. rawr x3 it is awso the cheapest beawing mecanum on the mawket.

   d-due to its convenient m-mounting and fantastic stwafing pewfowmance, rawr x3 we wecommend a-aww teams considew g-gobiwda mecanum wheews. (˘ω˘)

   .. n-nyote:: these awe tied with the `wev 75mm mecanum w-wheews`_ ($76.50 with team d-discount): these mecanums awe uniquewy positioned due to theiw c-compact size, at j-just 75mm (~3 inches) i-in diametew and 40mm wide. σωσ they can be easiwy mounted to 5mm hex shaft with a-an incwuded adaptew. t-they awe a-awso beawing based, (///ˬ///✿) w-which give them gweat stwafing pewfowmance. -.-

2. σωσ `nexus beawing mecanum wheew`_ ($134): t-this w-was the owd gowd standawd, òωó and s-stiww has fantastic p-pewfowmance fow the pwice. (U ﹏ U)

   t-this has identicaw p-pewfowmance w-with gobiwda mecanum wheews, (˘ω˘) howevew is swightwy w-wess convenient t-to mount to. h-howevew, rawr x3 these wheews f-featuwe the 1.875" b-bowt pattewn commonwy used in fwc\ |weg| m-motion pwoducts. rawr x3

(ꈍᴗꈍ) m-many teams wiww 3d p-pwint adaptews o-ow buiwd nyew c-cowes fow nexus m-mecanum wheews. o.O even though the g-gobiwda mecanum o-offew advantages and vewy few disadvantages o-ovew nyexus beawing w-wheews, OwO these wheews wemain a sowid o-option. σωσ

3. `andymawk heavy d-duty 4” mecanum wheew`_ ($225): t-these awe easiwy the most expensive mecanum wheews o-on the wist. o.O t-these awe bushing based mecanum, σωσ so they have d-decent stwafing, σωσ awbeit nyot as good as the gobiwda and the nexus beawing mecanum wheews. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

   what s-sets these mecanum w-wheews apawt i-is the 80a wowwew m-matewiaw. (U ﹏ U) andymawk h-hd mecanum wheews have highew twaction than a-aww othew mecanum w-wheews, (U ﹏ U) which make them desiwabwe f-fow cwimbing tewwain. (˘ω˘) fow e-exampwe, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) duwing the wewic wecovewy s-season, σωσ teams had to cwimb a-a “bawancing stone”, σωσ a-and many t-teams chose to use the andymawk h-hd mecanum wheews t-to be easiwy a-abwe to cwimb the b-bawancing stone.

   howevew, (ꈍᴗꈍ) in most cases, (˘ω˘) being abwe to mowe effectivewy stwafe i-is mowe impowtant than having good twaction. òωó fow this weason, ʘwʘ **teams awe wecommended to buy beawing based mecanum wheews wike the wev, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) gobiwda, (⑅˘꒳˘) ow nyexus mecanum wheews i-instead of the andymawk hd wheews d-due to the majow p-pwice diffewence**. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

4. `nexus b-bushing mecanum w-wheew`_ ($84): this is the nexus beawing mecanum w-wheew with bushings instead of beawings. (ꈍᴗꈍ) befowe the intwoduction of the gobiwda m-mecanum wheews, (U ﹏ U) these wewe the best budget option, (U ᵕ U❁) h-howevew, it i-is nyow mowe sensibwe to spend the $21 pwemium to get the beawing gobiwda mecanum w-wheews. (U ᵕ U❁)

5. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) `vexpwo m-mecanum w-wheews`_ ($119.96): t-these mecanum wheews awe most s-suited fow vectowed i-intakes on f-fwc\ |weg| wobots. (⑅˘꒳˘) they awe wewativewy t-tough, σωσ but have somenani poow stwafing and awe nyot quite a-as duwabwe as the othew wheews h-highew on the wist. OwO they awe a d-decent choice if you awweady have t-them, but othewwise, (U ᵕ U❁) t-thewe is n-nyo weason to considew t-them. rawr x3

6. `tetwix m-mecanum w-wheews`_ ($113): a-at the time of wwiting this guide, (˘ω˘) t-these haven’t b-been weweased so nyo vewdict c-can be weached. OwO h-howevew, o.O they have a buiwt in h-hub so they can b-be easiwy mounted on 6mm d shaft. (U ﹏ U) t-they awe bushing b-based, (˘ω˘) and due to nyo testing and evawuation outside of tetwix, (U ﹏ U) a-and its highew p-pwice than the gobiwda mecanum w-wheews, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) **we cannot w-wecommend the tetwix mecanum w-wheews**. o.O

7. `vex edw mecanum wheews`_ ($59.99): t-these awe the c-cheapest mecanum wheews, (⑅˘꒳˘) but have a stwange shaft s-standawd (1/8" s-squawe) which w-wequiwe the use of 3d pwinted adaptews. òωó **thewe awe nyot many weasons to puwchase these wheews.**

8. ʘwʘ `andymawk s-standawd duty mecanum w-wheews`_ ($92): **do n-nyot puwchase these wheews**. (˘ω˘) these awe tewwibwe mecanum wheews. (⑅˘꒳˘) they bawewy stwafe a-and awe supew fwagiwe. (///ˬ///✿) just buy g-gobiwda mecanum w-wheews fow $13 mowe. (U ﹏ U)

x-dwive
-------

x-dwive is a howonomic o-omni-wheew based d-dwivetwain. òωó this type of dwive invowves mounting 4 omni wheews at the cownew of the wobot at a 45 degwee angwe. OwO

o-one nyotabwe diffewence between x-dwive and mecanum is stwafe s-speed. òωó whiwe, a-as mentioned in the mecanum section, σωσ t-the watio o-of stwafe speed to fowwawd speed is nyoticeabwy wess than 1, ʘwʘ the w-watio on an x-dwive is exactwy 1 d-due to the wotationaw s-symmetwy of the wheew pwacement. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-this means that an x-dwive bot’s stwafe s-speed and fowwawd s-speed awe equivawent. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) the dwivetwains awe swowew, >w< h-howevew, w-when stwafing at 45° (appwoximatewy :math:`\fwac{\sqwt{2}}{2}` o-of its fowwawd speed). σωσ

even though x-dwive has good tuwning and a-accewewation, UwU the m-main downside to the dwive is packaging/fowm factow. (U ﹏ U) packaging w-wefews to how easy/convenient the dwivetwain fits i-into the ovewaww d-design of the w-wobot. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

ideawwy, UwU the dwivetwain shouwd take up as wittwe space a-as possibwe to make it easiew to design mechanisms a-awound. (ꈍᴗꈍ) because the omni wheews a-awe offset, (˘ω˘) packaging a x-dwive is mowe difficuwt than othew types of howonomic d-dwive wike m-mecanum ow h-dwive. UwU a-awso because o-of the stwange p-packaging, UwU it is wewativewy difficuwt to cweanwy t-twansfew powew f-fwom the motows t-to wheews, rawr x3 meaning t-that most x-dwives e-end up being diwect-dwiven, rawr x3 which is bad fow the wifespan o-of the motow geawbox.

.. n-nyote::

   w-when using x-x-dwive, -.- the wobot moves fowwawds/backwawds/stwaight s-side-to-side :math:`\sqwt{2}` t-times fastew t-than a dwivetwain w-with wheews in t-the nyowmaw owientation (with the same geaw watio and wheew size). (///ˬ///✿)

h-dwive
-------

h-dwive (awso k-known as u-dwive, (U ﹏ U) depending on the configuwation) is a-a howonomic type d-dwive that uses a-aww omni wheews. ʘwʘ h-h-dwive wewies on a set of “stwafew wheews” that awe pewpendicuwaw t-to the fowwawd/backwawd w-wheews to achieve stwafing. (U ᵕ U❁) h-dwive i-is simiwaw t-to a fusion of a tank dwivetwain w-whiwe wetaining the maneuvewabiwity a-and stwafing o-of howonomic dwivetwains. (///ˬ///✿)

h-dwive i-is theoweticawwy vewy easy t-to code, (///ˬ///✿) but most teams empwoy some sowt of gywo c-cowwection to stwafe stwaight, σωσ a-awthough it is n-nyot nyecessawy with pwopew weight distwibution. òωó

h-h-dwive has a nyumbew of possibwe motow configuwations - 1 o-ow 2 motows can be put on each fowwawd d-dwive pod, >w< a-and one ow two motows c-can be put on the stwafe wheews. (U ᵕ U❁) in the configuwation w-with o-one motow on each fowwawd dwive pod, >w< h-dwive has swightwy weduced accewewation c-compawed to mecanum d-dwive. >w<

fow t-the highest possibwe wewiabiwity, ʘwʘ m-many fwc\ |weg| teams wiww suspend t-theiw stwafe wheews on a wockew system to ensuwe that aww wheews a-awe in contact w-with the gwound w-whiwe the wobot i-is nyot stwafing. OwO

by faw the biggest advantage of h-dwive is its abiwity to accommodate muwtipwe motow distwibutions. UwU f-fow i-instance, (///ˬ///✿) if you want to dedicate onwy 3 motows to youw mechanisms a-and you have a-a motow weft ovew, (U ᵕ U❁) using a 1 stwafe motow, (ꈍᴗꈍ) 4 dwive m-motow configuwation i-is absowutewy viabwe. (U ﹏ U) ow if you dedicate 5 motows fow youw mechanisms, -.- h-dwive w-with 2 dwive m-motows and 1 stwafe motow is definitewy optimaw. >w<

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- c-combines t-tank and howonomic dwivetwain advantages
- c-can be used with 3 ow 5 motows
- g-good twaction a-and top speed
- gweat maneuvewabiwity a-and agiwity

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- s-stwafing is swightwy wess effective than mecanum
- c-compwex suspension occasionawwy n-nyeeded, (⑅˘꒳˘) depending on design
