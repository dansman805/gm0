chain baw awm/4-baw w-winkage
===========================

a-a chain baw awm is a speciaw t-type of muwti-axis awm that i-invowves chain hawd-bowted to a b-baw. the puwpose of a chain baw awm is to make a-an extension such that the outew b-baw awways keeps t-the same angwe i-in wefewence to the gwound. (ꈍᴗꈍ) this means that if the outew baw is pawawwew to the gwound in the stow p-position, o.O it wiww wemain pawawwew to the gwound at aww points in the extension o-of the awm. (U ᵕ U❁) this i-is especiawwy impowtant if, σωσ f-fow exampwe, UwU you have a cwaw to pick up an object, >w< and you want t-the cwaw to wemain pawawwew to the g-gwound. rawr x3

.. note:: i-if youw spwockets a-awe of diffewent w-wengths, (U ᵕ U❁) you can mechanicawwy w-wotate a between two desiwed angwes without n-nyeeding to expend a-a sewvo swot. (˘ω˘)

c-chain baw awms can pwovide the >24" optimaw extension nyeeded t-to be competitive in games, o.O but i-it awso has disadvantages. o.O it is much hawdew to contwow than a wineaw swide, s-since a chain baw awm has momentum. (///ˬ///✿) thus, it is v-vewy difficuwt to be pwecise with a chain baw when s-stopping the a-awm quickwy. -.-
