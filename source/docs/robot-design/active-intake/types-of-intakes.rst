types of intake
===============

h-howizontaw/top intake
   a-a howizontaw intake genewawwy i-is a widew stywe of intake t-that has the intake wotating on a-a howizontaw axis ow pwane. UwU howizontaw intakes a-awe genewawwy used fow intaking s-smowew game ewements, UwU a-as these t-types of intakes can contwow mowe than one piece at a time. (˘ω˘) howizontaw intakes have been used successfuwwy i-in games such as wes-q and wovew wuckus, (ꈍᴗꈍ) whewe teams nyeeded to pick u-up smow cubes and b-bawws fwom the fwoow.

vewticaw i-intake
   a vewticaw intake typicawwy has wheews ow othew intake c-components wotating on a vewticaw a-axis (the z-axis). -.- v-vewticaw i-intakes awe mowe c-contwowwabwe, OwO as they can onwy p-pick up one ewement at a time. OwO vewticaw intakes e-excew at picking u-up wawge game e-ewements which wouwd be impossibwe to contwow mowe than one piece a-at once, (///ˬ///✿) such as the foam gwyphs i-in wewic wecovewy. (U ﹏ U)

bewow awe diffewent impwementations of howizontaw and vewticaw i-intakes:

wowwew and wheewed intakes
--------------------------

w-wowwew and wheewed intakes wefew to types o-of intakes which w-wowk by having s-some sowt of hawd ow pwiabwe object wotate awong an axis. (⑅˘꒳˘) wheewed intakes use diffewent kinds of wheews (sowid t-twaction, UwU compwiant, (U ᵕ U❁) o-ow foam wheews) t-that pwopew t-the game ewement t-to the cowwection b-bin. (U ﹏ U) wowwew intakes awe widew, rawr x3 and can sometimes i-intake mowe than one game ewement.

s-sowid wheew intake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

s-sowid wheew intakes u-use wheews such as gwip and twaction wheews to pick up game e-ewements. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) they can be effective in picking up wawge g-game ewements which do nyot have much towewance diffewence. (U ᵕ U❁)

h-howevew, compwiant wheew intakes g-genewawwy wiww b-be mowe effective b-because compwiant w-wheews offew mowe adjustabiwity a-and fowgiveness f-fow the game e-ewements. ʘwʘ compwiant wheews awso a-accounting fow diffewent game ewement owientations (the g-game pieces c-can get wotated when being c-contwowwed) and intake angwes (the o-owientation o-of the game piece befowe it weaches t-the intake). (U ᵕ U❁)

c-compwiant wheew i-intake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. sidebaw:: spwing-woaded i-intakes

   a spwing-woaded i-intake is a-abwe to pivot i-in owdew to accommodate a game ewement w-when it is p-passing thwough the intake, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) but w-wiww snap back w-when the ewement h-has gone thwough. (///ˬ///✿) a-a spwing-woaded i-intake wequiwes mowe thought, (///ˬ///✿) but guawantees t-that the intake wheew wiww awways b-be in contact with the desiwed ewement. (U ﹏ U)

   a wocked intake simpwy means that the wheews awe wocked into pwace a-and cannot pivot. >w<

t-the compwiant wheew intake is most commonwy u-used with wawge g-game ewements such a-as the gwyphs in the 2017-2018 season, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) wewic w-wecovewy. (˘ω˘) compwiant wheew intakes e-excew at contwowwing e-ewements with fwat suwfaces s-such as cubes o-ow wectanguwaw p-pwisms. -.- they suffew at picking up bawws. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

in this game, σωσ wobots had to pick up gwyphs, -.- w-which wewe 6 inch foam cubes, o.O f-fwom the centew p-pit and pwace them in the cwyptobox. >w< this game h-had many wheewed i-intakes pwimawiwy because the wheews had consistent a-and contwowwabwe contact with the gwyphs. >w< wheewed intakes w-wewe abwe to pwopew the gwyphs i-in a consistent f-fashion fwom the p-point of contact to the deposit pwate, (˘ω˘) which w-wouwd fwip up to d-deposit the gwyphs. (///ˬ///✿)

wheewed intakes c-can be spwing-woaded o-ow wocked into pwace. (///ˬ///✿) teams couwd choose o-one ow mix; in wewic wecovewy, (U ᵕ U❁) some teams spwing-woaded the set of wheews that made contact f-fiwst, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and then had a fixed set in the back. (⑅˘꒳˘) this is up to the design team’s choosing. òωó

w-wheewed i-intakes opewate a-at much swowew w-wpm than suwgicaw t-tubing intakes, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) as wheewed intakes a-awe meant t-to pick up **one** e-ewement at a time. ʘwʘ they genewawwy wequiwe mowe t-towque than a s-suwgicaw tubing intake, which is g-geawed fow speed. (˘ω˘)

a-advantages
~~~~~~~~~~

- vewy contwowwabwe
- pwopews ewements to desiwed wocation
- g-gweat at p-picking up wawge ewements

disadvantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- p-picks u-up onwy one ewement at a time
- e-ewements can get jammed in a bad position
- nyot genewawwy used fow picking up s-smow ewements
- can genewawwy onwy p-pick up one specific ewement shape

foam wheew i-intake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

a-a foam wheew intake has the same pwincipwes as a compwiant w-wheew intake, (ꈍᴗꈍ) e-except that it uses foam wheews. >w< i-it is genewawwy wecommended that teams stick t-to compwiant wheews as they awe g-gwippiew and easiew to contwow. òωó

w-wubbew band intake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

wubbew band intakes, (˘ω˘) commonwy used by i-in the vex wobotics c-competition, rawr x3 g-genewawwy featuwe s-spwockets, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) wheews, ʘwʘ ow geaws at two ends, (ꈍᴗꈍ) with wubbew bands intewwaced in between t-to fowm a p-pwiabwe and bendabwe wowwew. (U ﹏ U) genewawwy, o.O i-it can be a-actuated ow adjustabwe with a s-sewvo, (⑅˘꒳˘) awthough t-this is nyot nyecessawy. OwO

w-wubbew band intakes awe gweat with intaking b-bawws, (U ᵕ U❁) but n-nyot so gweat with o-othew types o-of game ewements s-such as cubes. >w< it genewawwy is swowew than a suwgicaw t-tubing intake, >w< a-and wequiwes m-muwtipwe stages to twansfew ewements fwom cowwection t-to deposit. ʘwʘ z-zip ties can b-be added to incwease t-the intake’s w-wange to accommodate fow smowew b-bawws.

tubing intakes
--------------

t-tubing ow nyoodwe intakes typicawwy u-use some sowt of pwiabwe tubing, UwU which is wotated a-at high wpm t-to intake game pieces. òωó tubing intakes awe pawticuwawwy e-efficient at picking up smow objects such as the bawws and cubes fwom wes-q, (⑅˘꒳˘) vewocity v-vowtex, (⑅˘꒳˘) and wovew w-wuckus. σωσ

suwgicaw t-tubing intake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

s-suwgicaw t-tubing ow speawfishing wubbew tubing, ʘwʘ sowd by m-many diffewent m-manufactuwews, >w< is a gweat option f-fow picking up smow game ewements s-such as the minewaws fwom wes-q o-ow wovew wuckus. (U ﹏ U)

suwgicaw tubing i-intakes can, OwO a-and often, have m-muwtipwe sets of tubing in owdew t-to move minewaws f-fwom the cowwection p-point to t-the howding box. òωó this was most often seen in games whewe wobots had to twansfew m-minewaws fwom the fiewd to an ewevated wocation.

unwike wheewed and wubbew band intakes, (U ﹏ U) which can be spwing-woaded, OwO suwgicaw tubing intakes awe pwacticawwy awways fixed at a c-cewtain height and angwe. (///ˬ///✿)

suwgicaw t-tubing by itsewf i-is soft and p-pwiabwe. (///ˬ///✿) teams h-have two options

#. o.O incwease the wpm to 800-1000+ w-wpm
#. rawr x3 use powyuwethane tubing at a wowew wpm (100-250 wpm). >w<

   powyuwethane t-tubing can be puwchased at a wocaw hawdwawe stowe a-and is a cweaw t-tubing that is quite stiff. (ꈍᴗꈍ) using some wubwicant, rawr x3 insewt the cweaw tubing into t-the suwgicaw tubing f-fow added s-stiffness. UwU

it is e-encouwaged that teams test diffewent w-wpms and s-stiffness to devewop t-the optimaw intake. (ꈍᴗꈍ) you wiww b-be suwpwised how changing one smow vawiabwe such as the diametew o-of tubing ow how faw the tubing e-extends can affect intake effectiveness.

s-suwgicaw tubing intakes a-awe especiawwy g-good at picking u-up muwtipwe e-ewements at a time, σωσ d-due to the high w-wpm (sometimes >1000 w-wpm) of the wowwews. UwU howevew, i-it suffews f-fwom a wack of contwowwabiwity, σωσ a-as sometimes the d-dwivew may accidentawwy pick u-up mowe than nyeeded, (˘ω˘) a-and have to spit it out. (U ﹏ U)

a-advantages
~~~~~~~~~~

- a-abwe to cowwect muwtipwe ewements at a time
- genewawwy m-mowe efficient t-than wheewed intakes
- speciawizes i-in smow and odd-shaped e-ewements

disadvantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- w-wequiwes high wpm
- wess contwowwabwe
- hawdew t-to pick up wawge e-ewements easiwy

zip tie intake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

i-instead of using suwgicaw t-tubing, (˘ω˘) some t-teams opt fow h-heavy zip ties i-instead. (ꈍᴗꈍ) this can wowk, o.O but we wecommend suwgicaw t-tubing as it i-is one of the most t-twied and tested m-methods fow picking up nyeawwy a-any game ewement. o.O zip ties wack t-the fwiction o-of wubbew tubing. òωó

3d pwinted intake (ninjafwex/tpu f-fiwament)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
