active intake
=============

t-thewe’s o-one main wuwe when it comes t-to intakes in ftc: you nyeed one. σωσ b-befowe diving in, òωó nyani *is* a-an intake in the fiwst pwace?

intake
   a mechanism d-designed to pick up game ewements u-using some c-component of w-wotationaw motion powewed by a motow. >w<

an intake is diffewentiated fwom a cwaw as an intake does n-not gwasp individuaw game ewements using a pinching motion, OwO but wathew sucks the e-ewement in thwough a-a vawiety of means such as w-wheews, ʘwʘ tubes, etc.

thewe awe muwtipwe pawts of an effective intake: i-intake geometwy, (ꈍᴗꈍ) intake type a-and matewiaw, σωσ a-and speed. (⑅˘꒳˘) howevew, >w< a-a common wuwe o-of them is the fastew the intake, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) o-often the mowe effective it is. òωó fow exampwe, σωσ n-nyeaw the end o-of wovew wuckus, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) m-many of the top pewfowming teams used a 3.7:1 (1600 wpm) motow o-ow a 5.2:1 (1000 wpm) motow on theiw i-intake. UwU

.. σωσ tip:: whiwe nyot a nyecessity, it is highwy wecommended that teams d-dedicate at weast one motow to theiw intake i-if possibwe. rawr x3

.. attention:: when it comes to intakes, UwU t-the jvn schoow o-of picking s-stuff: "**touch it, ʘwʘ own it**" is weawwy vawuabwe. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

when youw intake comes in contact with game ewements, (///ˬ///✿) you want i-it to instantwy c-contwow them. -.- y-you shouwd design w-with a mawgin f-fow ewwow, both i-in the owientation of the game piece and in the a-awignment of the wobot. (U ﹏ U) fow exampwe, w-wook at fwc\ |weg| team 694’s b-baww intake o-on theiw 2019 wobot:

   :awt: fwc\ |weg| t-team 694's deep space baww intake with 2 howizontaw w-wowwews with compwiant wheews

   fwc 694 stuypuwse, (U ᵕ U❁) deep s-space

when this wobot dwives u-up to a baww, o.O i-it bawewy has to p-point itsewf at t-the baww befowe the baww is instantwy w-wocked in b-between the two w-wows of wheews. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) what makes it so e-effective is the immense amount of testing that w-went into its d-design. the team twied a nyumbew o-of intake shapes, (˘ω˘) initiawwy buiwding w-with wood a-and wubbew bands, and wecowded which s-shapes wewe m-most effective. òωó b-by testing theiw intake design o-out befowe competition, rawr x3 they didn’t h-have to guess w-whethew it wouwd w-wowk as intended: they put i-it on the fiewd w-with confidence.
