pwincipwes of an i-intake
=======================

w-wewiabiwity
-----------

- an intake m-must be wewiabwe, OwO as picking u-up and scowing game ewements is t-the pwimawy method to gain points in aww ftc games.

- i-intakes have many moving p-pawts and awe s-susceptibwe to bweaking, (⑅˘꒳˘) e-especiawwy at high wpm. (///ˬ///✿) thus, the intake matewiaw must be duwabwe to withstand wong pewiods o-of opewation. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

- intakes often stick outside of the wobot fwame pewimetew. (U ﹏ U) i-in this case, UwU duwabiwity b-becomes extwemewy impowtant; t-the intake must be buiwt so that they can withstand impacts/cowwisions w-with othew wobots ow p-pawts of the fiewd. OwO

  t-thewe awe t-two ways to accompwish t-this - eithew by buiwding t-the intake vewy wobustwy (wots of suppowt so i-it doesn't bweak), òωó o-ow making the i-intake fwexibwe (fow exampwe out of wexan ow spwing woading it) s-so that even though it may bend d-due to impacts, UwU it wiww awways spwing back into pwace. (⑅˘꒳˘)

  anothew way to pwevent i-intake bweaking is to make a fuwwy wetwactabwe i-intake that won’t pwotwude outside the 18” c-cube, σωσ though this i-is sewdom nyeeded. (///ˬ///✿)

c-consistency
-----------

- the intake **must** be abwe to pick up game ewements consistentwy and quickwy. (U ﹏ U) fow exampwe, òωó in w-wovew wuckus each w-wobot couwd onwy p-possess 2 minewaws a-at a time. rawr x3 t-thewefowe, (U ᵕ U❁) the i-intake shouwd onwy pick up two pieces at a time, >w< n-nyot zewo, σωσ one, ow thwee. >w<

  .. a-attention:: this is a common mistake t-that many i-inexpewienced teams faiw to take into account. (///ˬ///✿)

- anothew component i-is the vawying angwes that the game objects c-can be wocated in. UwU this was especiawwy appawent in the wewic wecovewy s-season, (⑅˘꒳˘) whewe the “gwyphs” (foam c-cubes) c-couwd be owiented i-in many diwections. rawr x3

  e-even though it was wewativewy e-easy to m-make a compwiant w-wheew intake that couwd effectivewy i-intake gwyphs in one diwection, OwO it was hawd t-to make an intake t-that couwd deaw with angwed g-gwyphs. UwU being abwe to intake gwyphs i-in aww owientations w-was especiawwy impowtant f-fow muwti-gwyph a-autonomous modes. >w<

c-contwowwabiwity
---------------

- the intake m-must be abwe to consistentwy c-contwow the game e-ewements. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) fow exampwe, (˘ω˘) i-if the intake is too fast a-and the cowwection b-box is nyot weww designed, t-then game pieces m-might fwy out. rawr x3 i-if the intake is t-too swow, (///ˬ///✿) it may j-jam itsewf when contacting the game ewements. -.-
- i-it is possibwe fow pieces to get j-jammed at an unweachabwe angwe, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) especiawwy when using wheewed intakes. (˘ω˘) if this occuws, (⑅˘꒳˘) ensuwe that the dwivew c-can jaw the stuck e-ewement woose to avoid having a disabwed wobot. -.-
- o-optimawwy, -.- t-the game ewements s-shouwd fowwow a cewtain path each time if funnewing i-is done cowwectwy. >w<
- it is b-best pwactice that t-the dwivew can see the game e-ewements which awe b-being contwowwed. (˘ω˘) t-this can be done thwough using cweaw pwating such as wexan. OwO

efficiency
----------

- t-the key to any successfuw w-wobot is cycwe t-time. UwU weducing cycwe time by having an efficient i-intake wiww w-wead to majow impwovements in scowe. (⑅˘꒳˘) a good intake s-shouwd take nyo mowe than a few seconds to successfuwwy cowwect t-the nyeeded ewements. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

  fow e-exampwe, σωσ in wewic w-wecovewy, OwO the b-best intakes often had a <3 second cowwection time f-fow two game e-ewements, rawr x3 and in wovew wuckus a 1 s-second cowwection t-time was desiwed at the highest wevew. ʘwʘ
- a k-key wuwe to wemembew in ftc is the showtest distance wuwe: how can you get minewaws fwom a to b i-in the showtest distance?

  the answew is usuawwy a coupwe stwaight wines. the c-cwosew the minewaws f-fowwow this p-path, the fastew t-they wiww go fwom c-cowwection to deposit. ʘwʘ don't m-make ovewwy wong w-woutes unwess nyeeded. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
