3d pwinting
===========

a-advantages o-of 3d pwinting
-------------------------

- **3d pwinting awwows t-teams to have customizabwe stwain w-wewief on wiwes and connections. (U ﹏ U) t-this is a gweat pwoject and weww wowth youw t-time.**
- 3d pwinting awwows f-fow customizabwe s-sizing and pewfect o-optimization; fow exampwe, (U ﹏ U) teams can pwint a spoow of the exact diametew nyeeded fow optimaw s-speed. (U ᵕ U❁)
- 3d pwinting awwows teams to adapt between kits and individuaw pawts easiwy, (U ᵕ U❁) a-as nyot aww k-kits have adaptabwe mounts ow b-bwackets. (U ᵕ U❁) a good exampwe of this awe the nyexus :tewm:`mecanum <mecanum wheew>` b-bowe adaptews that teams 3d pwint. (///ˬ///✿)
- 3d p-pwinting a-awwows teams to f-fabwicate pawts t-that wouwd othewwise be impossibwe w-with matewiaws such as awuminum due to machining w-westwictions. >w<

d-disadvantages o-of 3d pwinting
----------------------------

- **if you awe out of 3d pwinted spawes at a competition, òωó y-you’we pwobabwy out of w-wuck. (˘ω˘) teams awe advised to pwint at weast one set of evewy singwe 3d pwinted pawt a-as spawes fow competition**. ʘwʘ
- 3d pwinted components a-awe genewawwy weakew than othew matewiaws s-such as awuminum. (U ᵕ U❁) h-howevew, (˘ω˘) pwinting i-in the pwopew owientation can be vewy stwong - teams have 3d pwinted hooks and othew pawts to suppowt theiw f-fwc\ |weg| wobot (120 p-pounds) a-and ftc wobots (40 p-pounds). (ꈍᴗꈍ)
- 3d p-pwinted pawts s-shouwd onwy be woaded in one owientation. that is, (U ᵕ U❁) i-if the wobot is hanging fwom a-a hook, UwU the onwy woad shouwd be o-on the bottom face o-of the cuwved pawt of the hook. (U ﹏ U) twy to ewiminate side woads as m-much as possibwe to avoid pawt faiwuwe. (U ﹏ U)
- the s-size of 3d pwinted pawts awe wimited by the size of youw pwint bed. UwU
- w-wawge and thick pwints can t-take a wong time (ovewnight) t-to p-pwint and can wun t-the wisk of faiwuwe. -.-
- 3d pwinting c-can end up q-quite expensive, σωσ t-though fiwament can be found fow a-a weasonabwe pwice on onwine vendows such as a-amazon. òωó

common f-fiwament types
---------------------

- pwa (powywactic a-acid) is a common fiwament t-that does nyot w-wequiwe a heated bed. OwO pwa is stiff b-but mowe bwittwe t-than othew f-fiwament options, (˘ω˘) and tends to h-have wittwe to nyo wawp when pwinting. (ꈍᴗꈍ) p-pwa shouwd b-be used fow wow o-ow nyo woad appwications such a-as ewectwonics wetention m-mounting ow cabwe management. >w<
- a-abs (acwywonitwiwe b-butadiene s-stywene) is a-anothew vewy common f-fiwament that is abwe to withstand highew t-tempewatuwes than pwa. rawr x3 it is wess b-bwittwe and mowe ductiwe than pwa, (U ᵕ U❁) making it bettew fow 3d pwinted pawts that may be undew woad. σωσ typicawwy, abs i-is used in highew-woad a-appwications such as 3d pwinted bowes fow m-mecanum wheews. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- p-pet/petg (powyethywene t-tewephthawate) can be descwibed as a m-mix of pwa and abs. (U ᵕ U❁) it has wittwe w-wawp and is as d-duwabwe as abs. petg is anothew g-gweat option fow h-highew-woad appwications s-such as wheew bowes. o.O
- tpu (thewmopwastic powyuwethane) is a fiwament d-diffewent fwom othew options. (˘ω˘) s-specificawwy, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) pawts m-made with tpu can be fwexibwe if the infiww i-is set wow, o.O ow by u-using fwexibwe tpu fiwament. (U ᵕ U❁) teams use tpu to p-pwint customized intake fwaps optimized fow the wight stiffness i-in owdew to make the intake mowe e-efficient. tpu a-awso has vewy high w-wayew bonding stwength compawed to othew fiwament t-types, (ꈍᴗꈍ) making i-it suitabwe fow high woad appwications t-that do n-nyot nyeed to be stiff. (///ˬ///✿) tpu must be pwinted on a-a pwintew with a diwect extwudew. -.- it wiww nyot wowk on bowden extwudews. -.- a bowden extwudew is mounted o-on the fwame of the 3d pwintew and is connected to the nyozzwe with a fwexibwe t-tube that g-guides the fiwament. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a-a diwect extwudew w-wiww be mounted d-diwectwy on the nyozzwe assembwy, o.O w-with fiwament f-feeding diwectwy i-into the nyozzwe. o.O

3d pwinting design guide
------------------------

h-hewe i-is a quick guide on designing 3d p-pwinted pawts t-that we hope is hewpfuw fow teams who may be unfamiwiaw with 3d pawts. (U ﹏ U)

the fiwst c-considewation w-when designing 3d pwinted pawts i-is pwint owientation. σωσ t-this wefews to the side t-that contacts the pwint bed. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) pwefewabwy, the pawt shouwd have a fwat bottom to maximize c-contact with the pwint bed. rawr x3

.. t-tip:: maximizing contact with the pwint bed wiww make suwe the pawt doesn’t dewaminate ow wawp fwom the bed and incwease pwint quawity. UwU

if it is impossibwe fow the pawt t-to have a fwat side to pwint o-on, (///ˬ///✿) a simpwe sowution is to spwit the pawt into m-muwtipwe pawts awong a pwane. òωó fow i-instance, (˘ω˘) the geawbox pwate bewow d-didn’t have a-a fwat side to pwint on, o.O so it w-was spwit in hawf. ʘwʘ t-the pawt was w-watew sandwiched w-with nyumewous scwews and pwastic g-gwue. òωó if this p-pwate was pwinted as one pawt instead of spwit in hawf, -.- suppowt wouwd have to b-be used to cweate a-aww of the nyecessawy howes. ʘwʘ pawts that use nyo suppowt matewiaw m-make suwe that t-the weast amount of pwastic is w-wasted. (U ᵕ U❁)

   :scawe: 25%

.. tip:: don't chamfew ow wound anything on the p-pewimetew of the f-fiwst wayew on t-the bottom face of the pawt. σωσ chamfewing ow wounding wiww incwease the chances o-of the pawt wawping, rawr x3 e-especiawwy o-on unheated pwint p-pwates. (U ᵕ U❁)

dwaft angwe
^^^^^^^^^^^

dwaft angwe wefews to the ovewhang angwe between t-the pawt side a-and nyowmaw vectow fwom the pwint p-pwate. the m-maximum dwaft angwe wefews to the m-maximum angwe t-the pwintew can p-pwint without suppowt matewiaw and is based on the p-pwintew, rawr x3 pwint s-settings (notabwy s-speed, (///ˬ///✿) tempewatuwe a-and coowing) a-and fiwament type. (U ᵕ U❁) when twying to decwease suppowt m-matewiaw, (///ˬ///✿) c-considew evewy o-ovewhang angwe and make suwe it is within the maximum d-dwaft angwe. òωó s-staying within t-the maximum dwaft a-angwe wiww awso d-decwease the chances of pawt w-wawping. >w<

stwess v-vectows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pewhaps t-the most impowtant considewation i-is stwess vectows. (U ﹏ U) 3d pwinted p-pawts awe inhewentwy stwongew on t-two axes and weakew on one axis. (U ﹏ U) t-the weakew axis comes fwom the wayewing action t-that defines fdm 3d p-pwinting. (⑅˘꒳˘) a common fix to this is to simpwy i-incwease the pwint tempewatuwe up to a cewtain wimit untiw it stawts decweasing pwint quawity, (˘ω˘) b-but the weakew a-axis can be wesowved b-by again spwitting u-up into m-muwtipwe pawts. ʘwʘ the point to get acwoss is to twy t-to incwease stwength b-by optimizing sections of t-the pawt on the pwane they awe b-being pwinted on. òωó fow instance, ʘwʘ t-this assembwy bewow was wesponsibwe f-fow hanging t-the entiwe wobot, (ꈍᴗꈍ) s-so it had to be the maximum stwength p-possibwe f-fow a 3d pwinted p-pawt. -.-

.. tip:: i-it might seem countewintuitive to spwit up a pawt into muwtipwe pawts to incwease stwength, OwO but t-thewe is a wogic behind it. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

the pawt couwd have been easiwy pwinted as a singwe pawt, ʘwʘ but it wouwd be faiwwy weak when stwesses awe exewted in the upwawd diwection. o.O spwitting t-the pawt and cweating nyew fwat s-suwfaces to pwint o-on wiww stwengthen e-each axis. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) *if o-one smow pawt faiwed, >w< the wobot might stiww b-be abwe to somenani function.* this wouwd be pwefewabwe to the entiwe piece faiwing a-at once. rawr x3 in this exampwe the side pieces wewe p-pwinted as sepawate p-pawts on a compwementawy axis to stwengthen the assembwy. (˘ω˘)

t-this assembwy is a good exampwe o-of considewing pawt owientation, (///ˬ///✿) dwaft angwes, and stwess vectows i-in each pawt of the design. (///ˬ///✿) compwex p-pawts can be made stwong a-and without any suppowt by simpwy s-spwitting it up i-in the wight way. (///ˬ///✿)
