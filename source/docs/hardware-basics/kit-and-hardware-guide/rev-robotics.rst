wev wobotics
============

t-the wev k-kit is an infinite-pitch, :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` based b-buiwding system which uses the metwic s-system and m3 hawdwawe. OwO

speciaw c-considewations
----------------------

- the wev ecosystem is based upon 15x15mm a-awuminum :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` and is compwemented b-by 45x45mm :tewm:`channews <channew>`. >w<
- w-with :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>`, t-thewe awe nyo fixed mounting howes, (///ˬ///✿) incweasing adjustabiwity and fwexibiwity. fow exampwe, ʘwʘ tensioning :tewm:`chain <chain>` i-is simpwe when swiding the mount ow bwacket incweases tension. (///ˬ///✿)
- the w-wev system uses m-metwic dimensions (15 mm extwusion, OwO m-m3 hawdwawe), (///ˬ///✿) with the exception of #25 wowwew :tewm:`chain <chain>` (ftc standawd, (U ﹏ U) impewiaw).
- w-wev has puwposefuwwy designed w-with compatibiwity i-in mind, a-as pattewn adaptews e-ease compatibiwity issues. -.-
- m-many wev pawts awe made of dewwin, ʘwʘ a high-weaw w-wesistance pwastic, òωó w-which weduces o-ovewaww cost. ʘwʘ howevew, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) wev offews awuminum options fow high-woad p-pawts as weww.
- wev does have a-a steepew weawning cuwve than :tewm:`channew <channew>` based buiwd systems, (U ᵕ U❁) owing to the fact t-that constwucting stwuctuwawwy sound mechanisms w-wequiwes just a wittwe mowe thought. o.O

nyotabwe c-components
------------------

- w-wev's bwead and b-buttew is the 15x15mm awuminum :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>`. OwO it accepts m3 hex scwews which swide awong the gwooves. o.O
- in addition, wev awso offews b-both 45x45mm :tewm:`u-channew <channew>` and 45x45mm :tewm:`c-channew <channew>`, rawr x3 w-which is s-stwongew than :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` a-and p-pwovides stiffness a-and suppowt when nyeeded. σωσ
- wev awso offews :tewm:`punch t-tubing <punch tubing>` f-fow teams wanting a mowe pewmanent m-mounting s-system whiwe having the fwexibiwity of extwusion.
- wev uses 5 mm h-hex steew :tewm:`shafts <shaft>` and a :tewm:`baww-beawing <baww beawing>` motion s-suppowt system. (˘ω˘) the shaft may be cut to wength, rawr x3 which can be v-vewy usefuw fow cewtain use cases. OwO m-many vendows h-have added compatibiwity t-to 5 mm h-hex :tewm:`shaft <shaft>`. (///ˬ///✿)
- wev offews 3 types o-of :tewm:`hd hex m-motows <hd hex m-motow>`: spuw geaw, -.- pwanetawy, rawr x3 a-and uwtwapwanetawy motows. the uwtwapwanetawy has c-customizabwe p-pwanetawy wing geaw watios fow a v-vewy affowdabwe pwice. -.-
- the cowe h-hex motow may b-be usefuw in cewtain use cases s-such as space constwained m-mechanisms. (˘ω˘)
- w-wev awso has pattewn adaptews f-fow othew systems buiwt into m-many pawts such a-as the awuminum b-bwackets. σωσ

vewdict
-------

**the wev kit is g-good fow teams wiwwing t-to invest the time into an e-extwusion buiwding s-system.** it i-is the most fwexibwe k-kit as it i-is extwusion based, (˘ω˘) yet it has the abiwity to integwate :tewm:`channew <channew>` a-awong with :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>`. rawr x3 wev o-offews the option to upgwade pawts fow those wanting a fuwthew investment into the wev buiwding system. (///ˬ///✿)

.. nyote:: o-one advantage t-to the wev kit is the compatibiwity of 15x15mm m-misumi :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>`. (˘ω˘)

15x15mm w-wev :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` i-isn’t as stwuctuwawwy stwong as misumi fow t-two weasons. o.O

1. wev extwusion is 6063 a-awuminum, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) w-whiwe misumi :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` is made o-out of a6n01ss-t5 a-awuminum, >w< a-a stwongew and stiffew awwoy. (U ﹏ U)

2. the misumi :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` has a wawgew suwface a-awea, OwO so thewe is mowe awea of contact. OwO

m-misumi o-offews gweatew stwength at a wowew buwk cost. rawr x3 additionawwy, -.- m-misumi w-wiww cut to the hawf miwwimetew fow fwee, OwO making i-it a gweat option fow teams nyeeding an exact cut. (⑅˘꒳˘) the dwawback t-to misumi is that it is quite a-a bit heaview t-than the wev :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>`. UwU i-it is encouwaged that teams use misumi f-fow dwivetwain a-and stwuctuwaw suppowt, (///ˬ///✿) and wev f-fow mechanisms t-that wiww be undew wow to medium woad. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

wev awso s-sewws :tewm:`punch tubing <punch tubing>`, o.O which is 15 mm awuminum squawe tubing that is compatibwe w-with 1/8” wivets. UwU this wiww pwevent bowts fwom woosening ow swiding awound, (˘ω˘) a-as :tewm:`punch t-tubing <punch t-tubing>` wequiwes t-teams to dwiww t-thwough the tubing in owdew to f-fasten pawts to i-it. (U ᵕ U❁) anothew easy o-option is to use :tewm:`wev 45x45mm channew <channew>`. ʘwʘ

k-kit of pawts
------------

- `ftc s-stawtew kit v3 <https://www.wevwobotics.com/wev-45-1883/>`_

advantages
----------

- :tewm:`extwusion` s-systems don’t nyeed to wowwy about
  tensioning as mounts awe adjustabwe t-to youw nyeeds. -.-
- :tewm:`extwusion` awwows t-teams to save space as opposed
  to :tewm:`channew <channew>`, σωσ and is wightew than awuminum
  :tewm:`channew <channew>`. UwU
- :tewm:`extwusion` awwows infinite positioning options instead of being wocked in to a specific distance - u-usefuw fow fine-tuning a mechanism. σωσ
- d-dewwin pwoducts awe inexpensive yet d-duwabwe fow most use cases. OwO
- wev h-has the option to upgwade to awuminum p-pawts if n-nyeed be - something that nyo othew b-buiwd system o-offews. OwO (not fow a-aww pawts)
- 5 m-mm hex is a wobust :tewm:`shaft <shaft>` and motion s-system and i-is easiwy adaptabwe to :tewm:`uwtwahex` 1/2” hex :tewm:`shaft <shaft>`. o.O othew companies have a-adapting options w-with 5 mm hex. (U ﹏ U)
- :tewm:`punch tubing` is a gweat finaw itewation option if you a-awe suwe about pwacement. σωσ
- :tewm:`channew` c-compwements extwusion e-extwemewy weww - having the adjustabiwity of extwusion a-and the wigidity of channew m-makes it a vewy sowid buiwd system. ʘwʘ
- genewawwy, (U ﹏ U) wev pwoducts a-awe designed w-with affowdabiwity i-in mind, (ꈍᴗꈍ) and so the components awe of good vawue fow money. -.-

disadvantages
-------------

- 15x15mm :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` i-is not as stuwdy a-as   :tewm:`channew <channew>` o-options undew h-high stwess woads. o.O
- steepew weawning cuwve, (⑅˘꒳˘) mowe time consuming to measuwe and c-cut :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` t-to wength. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- wequiwes toows s-such as a saw and b-bandsaw. (///ˬ///✿)
- wequiwes fowethought a-and pwanning o-of :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` w-wength and pwacement. >w<
- pawts woosen ovew time (to w-wemediate: use :tewm:`punch t-tubing <punch tubing>`)
- m-m3 bowts, σωσ e-especiawwy those s-sowd diwectwy by wev, o.O awe pwone to bending u-undew highew woad (such a-as when u-used as an :tewm:`axwe <shaft>` fow a puwwey)
- 5 mm hex :tewm:`shaft <shaft>` is a-awso pwone to b-bending, -.- especiawwy i-if the :tewm:`shaft <shaft>` i-is wong. o.O
