befowe b-beginning youw season, òωó youw t-team is pwesented with a cwuciaw d-decision - one that wiww undoubtedwy h-heaviwy infwuence the team’s diwection o-of hawdwawe design in at weast t-the fiwst yeaw. UwU t-the *fiwst*\ |weg| s-stowefwont cuwwentwy offews two kits fow nyew teams: the tetwix kit fwom pitsco, (⑅˘꒳˘) and the wev s-stawtew kit fwom wev wobotics. σωσ howevew, teams shouwd cawefuwwy considew othew options, (///ˬ///✿) s-such as actobotics f-fwom sewvocity and gobiwda, (U ﹏ U) b-befowe sewecting a kit. òωó

evewy buiwd system has advantages a-and disadvantages, which we have h-highwighted in o-ouw detaiwed buiwd s-system guides b-bewow. rawr x3 whiwe the guide may nyot b-be fuwwy objective, (U ᵕ U❁) wecommendations awe based o-on ouw own expewience w-with the diffewent k-kits, >w< so the swant is thewe with weason. σωσ as with pwetty m-much anything in ftc, >w< thewe is n-nyo one wight answew - but thewe awe bettew answews than othews. (///ˬ///✿) hopefuwwy, this g-guide gives some sowid advice on which kit might b-be the best fow youw team. UwU

why use a kit?
--------------

a-aftew a-aww, pwenty of s-successfuw wobots have nyot fowwowed this fwamewowk. (⑅˘꒳˘) howevew, we stiww wecommend new teams puwchase a stawtew k-kit fow one big w-weason. rawr x3 estabwished t-teams awe aww b-but guawanteed t-to have spawe pawts w-wying awound to use to buiwd theiw nyext bot. OwO h-howevew, UwU wookie teams, >w< as is o-obvious, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) don’t have the pwethowa o-of pawts fwom p-pwevious seasons to use. (˘ω˘) thus, nyew teams shouwd puwchase these p-pawts themsewves in owdew to have something to b-buiwd fwom once the season stawts, rawr x3 and stawtew kits offew these p-pawts fow wess money than they wouwd b-be if bought i-individuawwy. (///ˬ///✿) a-as wiww be discussed, o-options that don’t invowve k-kits exist and a-awe cewtainwy v-vewy usefuw, -.- but sticking to pawts d-designed fow ftc is wecommended fow nyew teams a-as a stawting p-point. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

which kit shouwd one choose?
----------------------------

c-choice of a kit is a mattew of m-many a debate i-in ftc fowums, (˘ω˘) and each team has t-theiw favowites. (⑅˘꒳˘) i-if you awe a wookie t-team and do nyot have any e-expewience with any of the kits a-above, -.- we wouwd w-wecommend stawting w-with a kit fwom eithew wev wobotics o-ow gobiwda. -.- t-these kits pwovide good sewection o-of pawts, >w< wewiabiwity, a-and v-vawue fow money. (˘ω˘) t-they awe easiwy e-expandabwe and gweat pawt fwexibiwity awwows fow c-customization. OwO keep in mind that c-compatibiwity between kits vawies and wiww be impacted by the unit system used. UwU

- wev wobotics (metwic) is swightwy c-cheapew b-but genewawwy has a bit highew weawning cuwve than m-most othew kits, (⑅˘꒳˘) a-as it is :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` w-wathew than :tewm:`channew <channew>` based. :tewm:`extwusion` t-takes mowe effowt to wowk w-with (you nyeed t-to cut awuminum extwusion to w-wength); howevew, (ꈍᴗꈍ) i-it awwows fow m-maximum design fweedom and adjustabiwity. σωσ wev is awso avaiwabwe fwom *fiwst*\ |weg| s-stowefwont, OwO which might be c-convenient fow teams d-doing theiw puwchasing thwough officiaw schoow p-pwocuwement s-systems. rawr x3
- gobiwda (metwic) is swightwy mowe expensive, ʘwʘ b-but is easiew to get stawted with. ʘwʘ it has a extensive pawts c-catawog and can be adapted to o-othew buiwd systems w-wike wev. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) h-howevew, OwO its pwice point may detew some teams with w-wessew budgets. ʘwʘ
- t-tetwix (metwic and impewiaw) i-is pwobabwy the s-simpwest system to wowk with, but its pawt sewection i-is wimited, òωó and the use of :tewm:`4.7mm shaft <shaft>` with :tewm:`set scwews <set scwew>` is infewiow to :tewm:`cwamping h-hubs <cwamping hub>` used in othew systems. o.O
- actobotics (impewiaw) is simiwaw to gobiwda, being m-made by the same c-company. σωσ it has a-awways been a s-sowid option with w-wewiabwe pawts. o.O fow most ftc t-teams, òωó gobiwda wouwd p-pwobabwy be a-a bettew choice as it is mowe fwexibwe and compatibwe, (⑅˘꒳˘) u-unwess you a-awweady have a wawge stock of a-actobotics pawts. rawr x3
