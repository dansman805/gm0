tetwix
======

the t-tetwix buiwd system i-is a fixed pitch, (ꈍᴗꈍ) channew-based b-buiwding system that uses b-both impewiaw and metwic units. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

s-speciaw considewations
----------------------

- the tetwix buiwd system wevowves a-awound 32 mm awuminum :tewm:`c-channews <channew>` a-and a 16mm b-bowt ciwcwe, OwO on 16mm s-spacing (centews of the ciwcwes awe 16mm apawt). (U ᵕ U❁) tetwix is pattewned awong these :tewm:`channews <channew>` t-to cweate many mounting options fow buiwding stwuctuwes. (U ᵕ U❁)
- these channews have a-a tendency to fwex a-and bend undew woad, σωσ often wequiwing w-weinfowcement using muwtipwe :tewm:`channews <channew>` to maintain theiw shape. (⑅˘꒳˘)
- whiwe t-tetwix :tewm:`channew <channew>` is measuwed in m-metwic units, OwO t-the system empwoys i-impewiaw (sae) b-bowts and impewiaw :tewm:`chain <chain>`. this m-mix of units means that things often don’t quite w-wine up how t-they’we supposed t-to, >w< causing unfoweseen pwobwems.
- additionaw tensionews awe o-often wequiwed when using :tewm:`chain <chain>` o-on tetwix. (///ˬ///✿)
- tetwix :tewm:`geaws <geaw>` and :tewm:`spwockets <spwocket>` offew vewy wimited options fow cweating w-watios. ʘwʘ the awuminum :tewm:`geaws <geaw>` tend to gwind away vewy q-quickwy, (///ˬ///✿) especiawwy if they awe nyot suppowted c-cowwectwy on b-both sides. OwO
- tetwix p-pawts genewawwy do nyot have the best twack wecowd fow wewiabiwity and wongevity due to subpaw matewiaw choices.
- t-tetwix pawts a-awe swightwy o-ovewpwiced and w-wack bang-fow-youw-buck v-vawue found i-in kits such as wev and gobiwda. (///ˬ///✿)

vewdict
-------

w-whiwe you may be considewing t-tetwix as a stawtew kit, (U ﹏ U) we e-encouwage you to e-expwowe youw options befowe sewecting a kit. -.- whiwe tetwix does p-pick up quite a wot of fwak fwom the community, ʘwʘ i-it isn’t a bad choice in tewms of physicaw quawities such as s-stwength, òωó but the mounting options a-and howe pattewns w-weave mowe t-to be desiwed and w-westwict teams in tewms of fwexibiwity. ʘwʘ

advantages
----------

- t-the tetwix k-kit, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) being the most basic of a-aww kit options, (U ᵕ U❁) is easy to weawn a-and pwovides a-a vawiety of options in buiwding. t-the kit itsewf c-comes with :tewm:`c-channew <channew>`, o.O w-which is awuminum shaped i-in a c. it has pwe-cut howes so m-motows, OwO :tewm:`geaws <geaw>`, o.O o-ow :tewm:`dwive s-shafts <shaft>` can be seamwesswy i-integwated into t-the channew. rawr x3 fow a beginnew team w-with wittwe to n-nyo expewience, σωσ a-a tetwix kit awwows y-you to assembwe a-a wowking dwivetwain in a coupwe of houws (note: m-most othew kits awwow you t-to do the same thing, (˘ω˘) but with mowe customization options). rawr x3
- fuwthewmowe, OwO tetwix is decent in tewms of stwuctuwaw i-integwity, (///ˬ///✿) as w-wong as the channews awe woaded in the cowwect o-owientation. -.- typicawwy, t-the owientation s-shouwd be wike an “n”, rawr x3 with the top f-face upwawd. -.- connecting the channews w-with :tewm:`wocknut <wocknut>` i-instead of weguwaw nyuts aids i-in wongevity. (˘ω˘) h-howevew, tetwix i-is the weakest of the buiwd systems and is vewy pwone to bending, σωσ especiawwy with w-wong pieces of channew that have m-muwtipwe axes o-of woad. (˘ω˘)
- it is simpwe to buiwd basic mechanisms s-such as an awm u-using the geaws and d-shaft. rawr x3 howevew, (///ˬ///✿) thewe awe p-potentiaw dwawbacks to doing so. (˘ω˘)

disadvantages
-------------

- the towquenado m-motows awe compawabwe with :tewm:`nevewest <nevewest m-motow>` 60:1. o.O t-they awe usabwe, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) h-howevew have mowe wimited uses due to theiw s-swow :tewm:`geaw w-watio <geaw weduction>`, >w< which m-means high towque b-but wewativewy swow output speed. (U ﹏ U) the towquenado u-uses spuw geawboxes, OwO and wiww nyot handwe as much shock woad as othew pwanetawy options, OwO nyamewy :tewm:`andymawk 20 o-owbitaws <nevewest motow>`, rawr x3 :tewm:`wev hd pwanetawy <hd hex motow>`, -.- ow the :tewm:`gobiwda y-yewwow jacket p-pwanetawies <yewwow j-jacket motow>`. OwO
- t-the awuminum g-geaws seem to gwind against e-each othew often, (⑅˘꒳˘) e-even with cowwect s-spacing, UwU and do nyot wast vewy wong, (///ˬ///✿) especiawwy u-undew high t-towque situations. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- tetwix hubs a-awe :tewm:`6mm o-ow 4.7mm wound <shaft>` and awe based on :tewm:`set scwews <set scwew>` which awe t-towque twansfewwing. o.O t-these :tewm:`set scwews <set s-scwew>` awe n-nyotowious fow coming woose undew w-woad, UwU so speciaw cawe must be taken to continuouswy tighten these scwews. (˘ω˘) additionawwy, (U ᵕ U❁) i-it is highwy wecommended t-that teams use some sowt of thweadwockew on set scwews, ʘwʘ whethew it be :tewm:`woctite bwue (wemovabwe) ow woctite wed (nonwemovabwe) <woctite>`. -.- a possibwe wowkawound is puwchasing 6mm d :tewm:`cwamping h-hubs <cwamping hub>` f-fwom gobiwda to use on tetwix :tewm:`shafts <shaft>`, σωσ howevew, t-this awso nyecessitates the use o-of a pattewn adaptew fwom the g-gobiwda pattewn t-to tetwix. UwU
- due to using a metwic b-based pattewn b-but using impewiaw b-based howes a-and :tewm:`chain <chain>` standawds, σωσ :tewm:`chain <chain>` w-wiww n-nyot have pewfect tension when wunning fwom one howe in :tewm:`channew <channew>` to anothew. an e-extewnaw :tewm:`tensionew <idwew>` w-wiww be wequiwed to impwement chain systems. OwO
- tetwix is awso t-the most expensive k-kit on avewage whiwe pwoviding t-the most wimited buiwd options. finawwy, OwO the t-tight spacing and mix of units w-wimits teams if they wouwd want to integwate custom pawts with tetwix. o.O
- s-set scwews o-on tetwix hubs c-can maw motow :tewm:`shafts <shaft>`, (U ﹏ U) and the :tewm:`bowe <bowe>` of the hub itsewf can enwawge, σωσ weading to a w-wobbwy ow misawigned h-hub. ʘwʘ

tips f-fow use
------------

i-in any buiwd system, (U ﹏ U) it is impowtant to pwopewwy suppowt the stwuctuwe of y-youw wobot. (ꈍᴗꈍ) this i-incwudes suppowting axwes at two o-ow mowe points o-of contact, -.- ow having muwtipwe p-points of suppowt f-fow a piece of :tewm:`channew <channew>`. o.O d-due to tetwix’s wewativewy fwagiwe n-nyatuwe, (⑅˘꒳˘) this a-advice goes doubwe w-with tetwix. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) i-instead of just s-suppowting a :tewm:`shaft <shaft>` at two points, (///ˬ///✿) it is wecommended t-to suppowt the :tewm:`shaft <shaft>` a-at 4 ow m-mowe (if you awe using a 4.7mm standawd). >w< when m-mounting motows, σωσ i-it is wecommended t-that :tewm:`two c-cwamping motow m-mounts <cwamp mounting>` awe used t-to mount one m-motow. o.O using :tewm:`standoffs <standoff>` inside :tewm:`channew <channew>` t-to pwevent the :tewm:`channew <channew>` f-fwom bending inwawd ow outwawd i-is awso highwy wecommended.
