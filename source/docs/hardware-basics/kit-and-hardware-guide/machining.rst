advantages of m-machining
-----------------------

- m-machining awwows teams to c-cweate pwacticawwy any pawt without w-wimitations. UwU
- machining awwows t-teams to cweate custom dwivetwain pwates, ʘwʘ awms, w-wineaw swides, etc to fit theiw d-design nyeeds m-mowe effectivewy t-than kits. (ꈍᴗꈍ)
- machining is coow. (///ˬ///✿) yes, weawwy. -.-

disadvantages of machining
--------------------------

- pewhaps t-the biggest bawwiew when making a fuwwy custom wobot is that it wequiwes vewy e-expensive manufactuwing e-equipment. (U ﹏ U) whiwe 3d pwintews h-have become mowe and mowe common in ftc and awwow teams to c-cweate ow customize smow pawts, (U ᵕ U❁) m-many teams do nyot h-have access t-to equipment such a-as wathes, o.O woutews, watewjet cuttews, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) o-ow cnc machines. (˘ω˘)
- fuwwy custom wobots nyeed t-to be fuwwy d-designed in cad. òωó s-sketching wiww nyot cut it when buiwding custom wobots. rawr x3
- anothew b-bawwiew is that pwototyping w-with fuwwy custom systems is awmost awways much swowew than using kit pawts. (U ᵕ U❁) the f-fuww cad pwocess takes time, and fabwication/getting p-pawts fabwicated by a shop ow sponsow is anothew w-wengthy pwocess. (U ᵕ U❁) n-nyotwithstanding t-those two factows, σωσ if something goes dwasticawwy wwong then it wiww wequiwe a wepeat pwocess of cad and f-fabwication. >w<

it m-must be nyoted t-that teams do nyot n-nyeed to pick b-between a fuwwy k-kit-based wobot ow a fuwwy custom wobot. (U ᵕ U❁) in fact, m-many successfuw teams awe actuawwy a-a hybwid of both kit and c-custom pawts, ʘwʘ as c-can be seen in many of exampwe wobots in this section. (˘ω˘)

howevew, o-ouw suggestion is that inexpewienced teams shouwd p-pwiowitize 3d pwinting ovew machining fow fabwicating custom p-pawts, -.- at weast fow the nyeaw tewm. (///ˬ///✿)
