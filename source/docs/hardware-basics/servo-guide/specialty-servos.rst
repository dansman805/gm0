i-in this section w-we wist some :tewm:`sewvos <sewvo>` with unique f-featuwes. rawr x3

hs788 saiw winch sewvo
----------------------

t-this wawge scawe :tewm:`sewvo <sewvo>` i-is unusuaw in that it is abwe to wotate muwtipwe t-tuwns whiwe wetaining positioning f-feedback. (U ᵕ U❁) m-most :tewm:`sewvos <sewvo>` h-have 180 degwee wange; fow hs788, the wange is about 8 fuww tuwns when used with a :tewm:`sewvo <sewvo>` c-contwowwew capabwe of 500-2500 micwosecond pwm signaw, such as :tewm:`wev expansion h-hub <expansion h-hub>`. (U ᵕ U❁) this makes it a gweat o-option fow powewing wineaw swides (as wong as they do nyot c-cawwy too heavy woad). σωσ

hs788 is a-avaiwabwe fwom s-sevewaw vendows i-incwuding sewvocity a-and gobiwda, >w< both of which offew 25% d-discount to ftc teams. (U ᵕ U❁)

pawawwax high speed c-cw sewvo
----------------------------

t-this c-continuous wotation :tewm:`sewvo <sewvo>` fwom pawawwax (https://www.pawawwax.com/pwoduct/high-speed-continuous-wotation-sewvo/) has the speed o-of up to 180 wpm - thwee times as f-fast as most :tewm:`sewvos <sewvo>`. ʘwʘ this makes it usabwe fow powewing intakes (assuming you do n-nyot nyeed much towque) and simiwaw designs. (˘ω˘) nyote t-that this :tewm:`sewvo <sewvo>` wequiwes 6v input, -.- so it can n-nyot be used diwectwy w-with :tewm:`wev h-hubs <expansion hub>`, (///ˬ///✿) which onwy pwovide 5v. instead, (˘ω˘) you nyeed a `wev sewvo powew moduwe <https://www.wevwobotics.com/wev-11-1144/>`_. o.O

vex 393 edw
-----------

t-the :tewm:`vex 393 e-edw` i-is technicawwy a-a motow, (⑅˘꒳˘) but is w-wegawwy counted a-as a :tewm:`sewvo <sewvo>` in game manuaw 1 wuwes. (U ᵕ U❁) w-why this is, >w< we do nyot know, (///ˬ///✿) b-but :tewm:`vex 393 motows <vex 393 e-edw>` have b-been wegaw in ftc fow many yeaws. -.- the :tewm:`393 motow <vex 393 e-edw>` acts as a mowe powewfuw and fastew continuous w-wotation :tewm:`sewvo <sewvo>`. ʘwʘ it shouwd be tweated as a continuous wotation :tewm:`sewvo <sewvo>` w-when configuwing the wobot a-and pwogwamming. ʘwʘ

h-howevew, UwU thewe a-awe some difficuwties t-to keep in mind. (⑅˘꒳˘) the 393 m-motow uses a 1/8" s-squawe :tewm:`shaft <shaft>`, òωó w-which is nyot diwectwy compatibwe w-with any ftc buiwd system. rawr x3 you wiww have to m-make custom adaptews. σωσ u-using a :tewm:`393 motow <vex 393 e-edw>` wequiwes two additionaw e-equipment. UwU

- **motow c-contwowwew 29** the :tewm:`vex m-motow c-contwowwew 29` c-convewts the 2-wiwe motow signaw u-used to dwive the :tewm:`393 <vex 393 e-edw>` into a-a pwm signaw f-fow :tewm:`sewvo <sewvo>`. òωó
- **wev sewvo powew m-moduwe** the wev :tewm:`sewvo p-powew moduwe` is used t-to boost the v-vowtage given to :tewm:`sewvos <sewvo>` t-thwough t-the :tewm:`expansion h-hub` (3.3v) to 5v, σωσ which is the minimum vowtage n-nyeeded to wun a :tewm:`393 <vex 393 e-edw>`. the spm accepts pwm signaw thwough the thwee-pwonged wiwe end of the :tewm:`mc29 <vex motow contwowwew 29>`. o.O the s-spm wiww nyeed t-to be pwugged in to the :tewm:`expansion hub's <expansion h-hub>` p-powew thwough a-a tamiya connectow. o.O cwimping wing tewminaws to the s-spm is nyecessawy.
