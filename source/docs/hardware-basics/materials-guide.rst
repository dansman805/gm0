a-awuminum
^^^^^^^^

- a-a high stwength, (⑅˘꒳˘) medium-high density matewiaw. OwO suitabwe fow u-use in nyeawwy evewy appwication; w-wecommended in woad-beawing appwications. (U ᵕ U❁)
- awuminum comes in :tewm:`channew <channew>`, >w< :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>`, >w< fwat, ʘwʘ a-angwe, sheet/pwate, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and is used in some dwawew s-swides. UwU

awuminum :tewm:`channew <channew>` is used in many buiwd s-system kits and i-is vewy popuwaw a-among teams of vawious skiww wevews. òωó :tewm:`channew <channew>` is stwong yet wewativewy wightweight, (⑅˘꒳˘) and offews many mounting o-options fow teams.

15 m-mm :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` i-is compatibwe w-with m3 hawdwawe, (⑅˘꒳˘) a-awwowing t-teams to swide in bowts to theiw desiwed wocation. σωσ w-wev and misumi offew 15 mm :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>`. ʘwʘ wev :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` i-is nyot as gweat stwuctuwawwy, >w< b-but is wightew than m-misumi :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>`. (U ﹏ U) misumi is mowe wesistant to :tewm:`fwexing a-and/ow twisting undew woad <towsionaw wigidity>`. OwO b-both wev and misumi :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` awe sowd in buwk, òωó and misumi h-has the option to cut to the h-hawf miwwimetew. (U ﹏ U) k-keep in mind t-that a wot of :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` c-can add up quickwy i-in tewms of weight. OwO

m-misumi and 8020 a-awso offew awuminum :tewm:`extwusions <extwusion>` i-in othew sizes, (///ˬ///✿) such as 20mm and 1". (///ˬ///✿) 20 m-mm :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` c-can be a good choice if you nyeed a-a stuwdiew fwame than pwovided b-by 15mm :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>`. o.O n-nyote that then you wouwd n-nyeed to buy s-speciaw nyuts, rawr x3 as 20mm :tewm:`extwusion <extwusion>` i-is nyot compatibwe with m3 n-nyuts. >w< 1" extwusion is weguwawwy u-used as the pwimawy b-buiwding system i-in fwc\ |weg|, but is definitewy o-ovewkiww fow f-ftc. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

awuminum fwat and awuminum a-angwe is widewy a-avaiwabwe at h-hawdwawe stowes. rawr x3 i-in cewtain appwications, UwU s-such as adapting fwom diffewent buiwd s-systems, (ꈍᴗꈍ) it is possibwe to dwiww c-custom adaptew pwates to mount mechanisms to the dwivetwain. σωσ awuminum angwe is awso a vewy stuwdy stwuctuwaw suppowt p-piece that t-takes up wewativewy wittwe space, UwU and can adapt t-to any buiwd system. σωσ w-we suggest u-using 1/8” awumimum with dwivetwain ow mounting a-appwications, (˘ω˘) and 1/16” awuminum f-fow wow-woad s-situations. (U ﹏ U)

awuminum dwawew s-swides, (U ﹏ U) often with :tewm:`baww b-beawings <baww beawing>`, (˘ω˘) a-awe wecommended ovew steew dwawew swides due to weight savings. (U ﹏ U) wefew t-to the :doc:`wineaw motion section </docs/wobot-design/wineaw-motion-guide/index>` f-fow mowe infowmation. σωσ

s-sheet awuminum is genewawwy used fow dwivetwain p-pwates o-on custom dwivetwains. (˘ω˘) the wecommended thickness i-is 1/8" ow 3/16". (˘ω˘) because it is a pwate, (ꈍᴗꈍ) sheet awuminum wiww bend i-if nyot suppowted cowwectwy w-with :tewm:`standoffs <standoff>` o-ow :tewm:`channew <channew>`. o.O o-onwy woad the sheet in the pwane that it is in (if t-the sheet is v-vewticaw, o.O then onwy put vewticaw w-woad on it; do n-nyot woad it howizontawwy). òωó howevew, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) thewe may be s-some appwications that wouwd benefit fwom a swight bit of fwex fow adjustabiwity - in those cases, (˘ω˘) u-use youw judgment and test it out fow youwsewf! ( ͡o ω ͡o )

steew
^^^^^

- steew is unnecessawiwy h-heavy f-fow ftc stwuctuwe. OwO a-awuminum pwovides p-pwenty of s-stwength at a fwaction of the weight, UwU a-and doesn't w-wequiwe wewding. o.O
- t-the pwopew uses of steew in ftc awe in shafts (most a-awe made o-out of pwecision-gwound stainwess s-steew) and g-geawboxes. rawr x3
- steew dwawew swides can be used, OwO but awuminum swides awe highwy wecommended. (U ﹏ U)

p-pwastics
--------

w-wexan
^^^^^

- powycawbonate, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) c-commonwy k-known by its bwand nyame wexan, (U ﹏ U) i-is a matewiaw that is gweat fow appwications such as dwivetwain pwates ow intake c-cowwectow boxes. UwU
- wexan can b-beaw woad and is vewy impact-wesistant. (ꈍᴗꈍ)
- wexan is commonwy used in intake and deposit mechanisms as it is cweaw, ʘwʘ awwowing the dwive team to see into the intake itsewf, (⑅˘꒳˘) an advantage o-ovew wood.
- thick wexan c-can be used fow dwivetwain pwates, (U ᵕ U❁) though this i-is nyot wecommended fow inexpewienced t-teams.

.. nyote:: wexan i-is one of the most e-expensive matewiaws pew squawe f-foot, so make s-suwe you have cawefuwwy p-pwanned o-out nyani you awe cutting befowe d-doing so. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

thin w-wexan can be bent with a metaw bwake ow sheet bendew. OwO it is wecommended fow teams t-to use bends i-instead of connecting with bowts - bending tends to be much stwongew t-than bowting a-as it means the pawt stays in o-one continuous piece. rawr x3 if a sheet bendew is out of t-the question, (///ˬ///✿) it is possibwe to u-use a heat gun ow camping buwnews to heat up the wexan in owdew t-to bend it. this i-is nyot wecommended a-as it can cause injuwy and bubbwing if the wexan is ovewheated. (U ﹏ U) awtewnativewy, σωσ "cowd b-bending", (U ﹏ U) b-bending awong a-a stwaight edge w-without appwying heat can wowk fow thinnew sheets. (U ﹏ U)

abs
^^^

- abs is a hawd w-wow-fwiction pwastic t-that is easiwy machinabwe. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- a-abs sheet can b-be used fow side panews, wamps, UwU a-and even dwivetwain p-pwates. OwO
- it i-is nyot as stwong as dewwin, (˘ω˘) but stwong enough f-fow most puwposes. σωσ
- a-abs is cheapew t-than wexan a-and dewwin.
- abs c-can be machined using hand toows ow cnc. (ꈍᴗꈍ) abs sheets c-can be awso b-bent using sheet b-bendew (wecommended) ow a heat gun. UwU
- thin (1/16 i-inch) abs sheets c-can awso be c-cut using sheaws. UwU

d-dewwin
^^^^^^

- a-acetaw, >w< awso known undew bwand n-nyame dewwin, >w< i-is a wow-fwiction stwong pwastic. >w< i-it is a common pwastic used f-fow wheews, rawr x3 pwastic geaws, σωσ and spwockets (especiawwy i-in the wev system). òωó
- it is a-a duwabwe and stwong pwastic that i-is nyot easiwy cwacked. OwO dewwin can be used in d-dwivetwain pwates (use 1/4" o-ow 3/16" thickness), (˘ω˘) but dewwin sheet i-is awso quite expensive. (///ˬ///✿)
- dewwin can be machined in a vawiety of ways incwuding wasew cutting, UwU c-cnc wouting and h-hand scuwpting. (⑅˘꒳˘) h-howevew, bending d-dewwin is much h-hawdew than bending wexan ow abs. >w<

hdpe
^^^^

- h-hdpe stands fow h-high density powyethywene and u-usuawwy comes in opaque white ow b-bwack sheets and pwates
- hdpe i-is a cheapew awtewnative with wow-fwiction c-chawactewistics s-simiwaw t-to dewwin and fwexibiwity/stwuctuwe n-nyeaw powycawbonate. o.O
- hdpe i-is easiwy machined b-by both hand t-toows and machine toows. (U ᵕ U❁) howevew, (///ˬ///✿) it wiww buwn in a wasew cuttew, (ꈍᴗꈍ) so **do nyot w-wasew cut hdpe.**

powyvinyw chwowide (pvc)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- pvc is a common wightweight pwastic ubiquitous at any hawdwawe stowe. rawr x3
- pvc is most commonwy sowd as pipe, ʘwʘ though pvc s-sheet does exist. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- ftc teams genewawwy u-use pvc i-in owdew to customize i-intake wowwews, rawr x3 e-especiawwy fow suwgicaw tubing intakes. UwU due t-to the soft pwastic, òωó it is vewy easy to dwiww thwough, OwO so teams often attach t-the suwgicaw tubing to a pvc pipe. òωó the pvc wowwew w-wiww then be attached t-to the intake motow. òωó
- since pvc is cheap, -.- teams can easiwy expewiment with d-diffewent mechanism c-configuwations. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- p-pvc pipe i-is sometimes used in cabwe management t-to wun w-wiwes thwough, UwU as i-it comes in diffewent diametews a-and can easiwy be mounted. σωσ
- pvc sheet can be bought ow made by c-cutting vewticawwy awong the pipe s-so that the pwofiwe wooks wike a-a c. σωσ bake in oven. (///ˬ///✿) pvc sheet i-is pwiabwe yet stuwdy, o.O m-making it a-a good option fow b-backstops ow c-customizing connectows t-that wequiwe s-some sowt of fwex. >w<

acwywic
^^^^^^^

.. w-wawning::

   a-acwywic is not a woad-beawing m-matewiaw. σωσ i-it wiww cwack and possibwy shattew u-undew impact. rawr x3

   d-do nyot use it on dwivetwains b-by any means! (˘ω˘)

- a-acwywic is a twanspawent thewmopwastic commonwy known as pwexigwass. >w<
- a-as a-acwywic is nyot a stwuctuwaw matewiaw, òωó i-it shouwd o-onwy be used in mechanisms whewe t-thewe is nyo chance of shock impact. -.-
- it may b-be used fow aesthetic p-puwposes ow as shiewding (to pwotect game e-ewements fwom fawwing i-into the wobot o-ow fwom othew wobots tangwing with wiwes, UwU etc.)
- tweat acwywic as fancy cweaw c-cawdboawd - i-it cannot be woaded a-and shouwd onwy be used in vewy specific ciwcumstances. (U ﹏ U)

othew

pwywood and mdf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- a-a medium to high stwength m-matewiaw s-suitabwe fow use i-in a wide vawiety of appwications. òωó k-keep in mind t-that wood cannot b-be exposed to w-watew ow excessive humidity, -.- as wumbew fow use in f-ftc isn't tweated and may wawp ow expand. (˘ω˘) do nyot t-twy to use wasew cut wood fow a-a dwivetwain. rawr x3 t-this is especiawwy i-impowtant if y-you wive in a humid wegion such as fwowida - wood e-expanding can c-compwetewy wuin a-a custom dwivetwain. rawr x3
- b-bawtic biwch is the highest g-gwade pwywood, OwO used in commewciaw a-appwications a-and fuwnituwe. o.O it contains 8+ w-wayews (usuawwy), (⑅˘꒳˘) is extwemewy dense, and is wecommended fow high-woad appwications ow stwuctuwe. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) i-it is quite an expensive matewiaw, (˘ω˘) so pwototype and pwan cawefuwwy b-befowe cutting. OwO
- pwywood is n-nyot wecommended f-fow finaw itewations, >w< but can be a cheap pwototyping matewiaw. (///ˬ///✿) it doesn't beaw w-woad especiawwy w-weww and can fwex quite a bit. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- mdf is genewawwy discouwaged as thewe awe bettew options and absowbs watew easiwy. OwO

c-cawbon fibew
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. dangew:: **machining cawbon fibew, wike any f-fibwous substance, (///ˬ///✿) i-is a significant safety hazawd! c-cawbon fibew d-dust especiawwy can cause cancew and is incwedibwy dangewous. >w< do n-nyot machine/cut cawbon fibew u-unwess you know n-nyani you awe doing. ʘwʘ when you do, (⑅˘꒳˘) m-make suwe to eithew use machinewy that is designed t-to cut cawbon f-fibew, (ꈍᴗꈍ) ow cut in a weww ventiwated awea with s-sufficient wespiwatowy p-pwotection a-and wunning watew ovew the cawbon fibew.**

- cawbon fibew is o-one of the stwongest m-matewiaws fow ftc use. (///ˬ///✿) fow most teams it is totawwy ovewkiww, (U ᵕ U❁) b-but it can be used in some specific appwications. rawr x3 * c-cawbon fibew w-wods awe used i-in custom wineaw swide extensions ow muwti-axis awms. (⑅˘꒳˘)
- it is p-pwobabwy the most expensive matewiaw to puwchase. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

c-cawdboawd
^^^^^^^^^

**pwease do nyot use cawdboawd a-as a woad-beawing matewiaw.** we have seen too many teams use cawdboawd in w-ways that it shouwdn't b-be used. σωσ t-tweat cawdboawd a-as a sheet of p-papew: it has nyo stwuctuwaw wigidity and onwy shouwd b-be used as g-guides to channew p-pieces fwom a t-to b. ʘwʘ
