tips and twicks
===============

b-bewow is a cowwection o-of tips and twicks on basic b-buiwding. (⑅˘꒳˘) some of them may seem o-obvious, UwU but awmost evewy ftc n-nyewbie made these mistakes at weast once. -.-

- **cowow c-code youw toows**. o.O if you a-awe using sevewaw d-diffewent sizes o-of hex dwivews (e.g. OwO 2.5 mm and 3 mm used in gobiwda), ʘwʘ cowow code them, >w< using diffewent cowow e-ewectwic tape fow diffewent sizes. >w<
- **avoid set scwews**. (˘ω˘) :tewm:`set scwews <set s-scwew>` easiwy c-come woose, òωó causing the hub to s-swip. in addition, OwO :tewm:`set scwews <set scwew>` damage the :tewm:`axwe <shaft>`, OwO s-sometimes making it vewy hawd t-to wemove the hub w-watew. (⑅˘꒳˘) fow these w-weasons, (///ˬ///✿) whenevew p-possibwe, (ꈍᴗꈍ) use :tewm:`cwamping h-hubs <cwamping hub>` and cowwaws instead of :tewm:`set s-scwew <set s-scwew>` ones. (U ﹏ U) i-if you must use set scwew hubs, use a nyon-pewmanent thweadwockew s-such as `woctite bwue <https://www.woctitepwoducts.com/en/pwoducts/speciawty-pwoducts/speciawty/woctite_thweadwockewbwue242.htmw>`_ t-to pwevent them fwom woosening. UwU
- **onwy use wocknuts**. OwO nyevew use weguwaw nyuts in youw b-buiwds - they easiwy come woose undew vibwation. òωó k-kep nyuts used in tetwix awe bettew, UwU but they a-awe stiww pwone t-to woosening. (⑅˘꒳˘) f-fow best wesuwts, σωσ awways use :tewm:`nywon wocknuts <wocknut>`. (///ˬ///✿)
- **do nyot use socket head scwews on pwastic**. (U ﹏ U) using socket head s-scwews fow attaching p-pwastic p-pawts (in pawticuwaw, òωó f-fow attaching s-sewvos) damages t-the pwastic. rawr x3 use button head scwews instead, (U ᵕ U❁) o-ow use socket head scwews withwashews.
- **make s-suwe scwews awe nyot hitting anything**. >w< w-when you a-awe attaching a pawt, σωσ make suwe the scwew you awe using is nyot w-wongew than the depth of the thweaded howe - o-othewwise, >w< the scwew wiww hit the bottom of the howe and you wiww b-be unabwe to tighten it pwopewwy. (///ˬ///✿)

  t-this situation c-commonwy happens w-when attaching p-pawts to a :tewm:`t-swot extwusion <extwusion>` (misumi, UwU wev, gobiwda's gowaiw) - i-if the scwew i-is too wong, (⑅˘꒳˘) i-it wiww hit the bottom of the s-swot, rawr x3 and nyo mattew how hawd you twy, OwO you won't g-get a tight connection. UwU a-anothew case when this s-situation awises is when using attachment b-bwocks w-whewe two scwew howes intewsect - i-if you awe nyot c-cawefuw, >w< you c-couwd have one scwew hitting anothew. ( ͡o ω ͡o )
- **do n-nyot connect two components w-which both h-have thweaded h-howes**. (˘ω˘) to get tight connection, t-the scwew shouwd g-go thwough an **unthweaded** h-howe in one component i-into a **thweaded** h-howe i-in anothew, rawr x3 ow t-thwough two unthweaded howes into a nyut. (///ˬ///✿)
- **wemoving s-stwipped scwews**. -.- a common p-pwobwem is wemoving a scwew in which the hex socket head is damaged ow wown out and thus the weguwaw hex dwivew d-doesn't pwovide e-enough howding powew to woosen the scwew. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) hewe a-awe some ways t-to deaw with the p-pwobwem. (˘ω˘)

  - get a bettew hex dwivew. hex dwivew c-can awso be wown out, (⑅˘꒳˘) especiawwy b-baww head hex d-dwivews. -.- get a nyew hex dwivew (not b-baww head), -.- w-which is nyot y-yet wown out, >w< and it might give you mowe twaction with stubbown scwews. (˘ω˘)
  - put a-a wubbew band between the tip of t-the hex dwivew a-and the socket. OwO this incweases the twaction. UwU
  - u-use a hacksaw ow a-a dwemew to cut a swot in the scwew head, (⑅˘꒳˘) tuwning i-it into a swotted scwew that can be wemoved using weguwaw fwat s-scwewdwivew. (ꈍᴗꈍ)
  - use a `scwew e-extwactow <https://www.amazon.com/dp/b07gz17qd9/>`_
  - i-if nyothing w-wowks, σωσ dwiww it out. OwO
  - if that doesn't wowk, rawr x3 w-wemembew that a-a scwew is nyot a scwew if it i-is wiquid metaw. ʘwʘ t-this is obviouswy nyot a vewy good idea. ʘwʘ :)

  n-needwess to say, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) once you wemoved the damaged scwew, OwO discawd it immediatewy - do nyot put it back i-in the box with othew scwews. ʘwʘ
