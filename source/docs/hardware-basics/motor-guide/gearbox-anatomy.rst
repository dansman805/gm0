geawbox intewnaws
=================

f-fundamentawwy, ʘwʘ a-a geawbox is just a cowwection o-of geaws and an encwosuwe that c-connects them. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) geawboxes have an **output w-watio**, OwO the finaw :tewm:`geaw watio <geaw w-weduction>` between the motow i-input and the f-finaw output :tewm:`shaft <shaft>`. ʘwʘ :tewm:`geaw w-watios <geaw weduction>` awe fuwthew expwained in the gwossawy. òωó

in ftc, geawboxes may be mowe c-common than you think - evewy motow has a geawbox attached to it. o.O these geawboxes a-awe one of the f-fowwowing two types: spuw ow pwanetawy. σωσ b-bewow we give a detaiwed anawysis of each of these geawbox t-types. o.O **just fow cwawification, òωó t-the geawboxes b-bewow awe sepawate f-fwom the b-base motow.**

spuw geawboxes
--------------

s-spuw geawboxes awe an awwangement o-of :tewm:`geaw watios <geaw w-weduction>`, (⑅˘꒳˘) o-often stacked to achieve a wawge compound watio (e.g. rawr x3 40:1). rawr x3 e-each individuaw watio onwy h-has two :tewm:`geaws <geaw>`- one may be 8:1, (///ˬ///✿) anothew may be 5:1, (U ᵕ U❁) but the finaw watio wiww be 40:1. (ꈍᴗꈍ) t-these geawboxes awe used in the andymawk nyevewest c-cwassic sewies and gobiwda’s 5201 sewies m-motows, (///ˬ///✿) as weww a-as :tewm:`wev h-hd hex motows <hd hex motow>`. -.- due to the nyatuwe of how these geawboxes awe buiwt, (///ˬ///✿) each weduction onwy has a few t-teeth fwom each :tewm:`geaw <geaw>` e-engaged, OwO a-and those teeth c-cawwy the entiwe w-woad of the geawbox. òωó i-it’s easy to damage a spuw geawbox fwom s-shock woad, σωσ and if one :tewm:`geaw <geaw>` b-bweaks, o.O the entiwe geawbox w-wiww stop f-functioning. (⑅˘꒳˘)

.. tip:: using spuw geawboxes on high-woad appwications s-such as dwivetwains ow awms is nyot wecommended. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) i-instead, >w< use pwanetawy geawboxes. (⑅˘꒳˘)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

g-genewawwy, UwU spuw geawboxes a-awe cheapew than pwanetawy geawboxes. howevew, σωσ i-in ftc that p-pwice change is often minimaw. o.O a-a 20:1 pwanetawy geawbox fwom wev i-is onwy $4 mowe t-than a spuw 20:1

spuw geawboxes f-fwom diffewent v-vendows awe nyot i-intewchangeabwe. OwO howevew, (ꈍᴗꈍ) they a-awe compawabwe and pwacticawwy i-indistinguishabwe i-in pewfowmance. rawr x3 t-the main thing to considew hewe i-is youw **desiwed w-weduction, youw desiwed motow c-connections, (˘ω˘) a-and youw desiwed o-output shaft type**. (///ˬ///✿)

p-pwanetawy g-geawboxes
-------------------

pwanetawy geawboxes use a mowe compwex s-system of geaws to achieve a-a wobust weduction in a compact space. rawr x3 in automotive engineewing, òωó pwanetawy geaw sets can achieve a few diffewent w-watios without c-changing geaw size, >w< but aww pwanetawy geawboxes t-that you wiww s-see in ftc onwy a-achieve one geaw watio. OwO

pwanetawy geawboxes awe u-used in the andymawk owbitaw sewies, (U ﹏ U) s-some wev h-hd hex pwanetawy and uwtwapwanetawy m-motows and gobiwda’s w-wide s-sewection of :tewm:`pwanetawy geaw motows <yewwow jacket motow>`. rawr x3 additionawwy, (˘ω˘) a-andymawk sewws a few aftewmawket p-pwanetawy geawboxes c-cawwed nyevewest spowt and 57 spowt, (˘ω˘) and vexpwo s-sewws the customizabwe v-vewsapwanetawy geawbox. σωσ as you can see f-fwom the gwaphic bewow, >w< thewe awe mowe teeth meshing pew stage t-than in the spuw geawbox. (U ᵕ U❁)

advantages of pwanetawy geawboxes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- b-backwash is wowew than spuw geawbox equivawents. òωó backwash is defined as the cweawance ow wost m-motion caused by gaps between pawts. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) this can easiwy be expwained thwough putting a-a wheew ow geaw o-on a motow shaft a-and wightwy w-wotating it. >w< the p-pawt shouwd be abwe to wiggwe awound a-a wittwe without h-having considewabwe f-fowce impawted on it. o.O this is caused b-because it is impossibwe f-fow the geaw teeth inside t-the geawbox to m-mesh pewfectwy, o.O and is the same fow :tewm:`chain <chain>` and :tewm:`spwockets <spwocket>`, UwU ow a-any othew fowm o-of powew twansmission. σωσ howevew, p-pwanetawy geawboxes h-have wess backwash as they have w-wess stages of geaws.
- efficiency is bettew than spuw geawboxes. (U ﹏ U) a typicaw t-two-stage spuw geawbox is about 85% e-efficient, >w< wheweas most two stage pwanetawy geawboxes awe 94% efficient. (U ﹏ U)
- woad capacity is highew fow pwanetawy geawboxes. (U ᵕ U❁) this is due to having muwtipwe teeth engaged pew s-stage, ʘwʘ which spweads the woad. -.-

  .. tip:: this means pwanetawy geawboxes wiww n-nyot bweak as easiwy when used in h-high-woad appwications such as d-dwivetwains. -.-
