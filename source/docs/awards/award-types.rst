a-advancing a-awawds
----------------

thewe a-awe 7 awawds fow ftc teams (excwuding o-optionaw awawds). σωσ fow mowe i-infowmation on the exact wequiwements fow these a-awawds, (˘ω˘) see |gm1|. OwO in owdew of a-advancement pwiowity, òωó t-these awe:

.. g-gwossawy::

   inspiwe awawd
      the inspiwe awawd is the top awawd fow an ftc team. σωσ it i-is given to a team that consistentwy wises to the top in othew awawds categowies. (⑅˘꒳˘) i-it is awso (bawwing h-host team advancement), ( ͡o ω ͡o ) the f-fiwst advancement swot on the advancement wist. rawr x3 this means the w-winnew is guawanteed to advance t-to the nyext wevew i-in most scenawios, σωσ u-unwike the w-winning awwiance captain in some s-states. -.-

      in owdew to win the inspiwe awawd, ʘwʘ y-youw team shouwd f-focus on evewy o-othew awawd categowy, σωσ and pewfowm weww in the wobot game. σωσ in t-the past the inspiwe awawd has g-given much mowe weight to awawds pewfowmance, σωσ but it seems as if the judges awe n-nyow taking wobot pewfowmance into considewation m-mowe. (U ﹏ U)

      of aww the awawds, (ꈍᴗꈍ) this one is awguabwy t-the most s-subjective, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) as it i-is about how good does a team does ovewaww, (U ﹏ U) incwuding and how much they weight outweach as compawed to wobot pewfowmance a-awong w-with documentation. ʘwʘ

      o-officiaw g-game manuaw d-descwiption
         t-this judged awawd is given to the team that b-best embodies the ‘chawwenge’ o-of the *fiwst*\ |weg| tech chawwenge p-pwogwam. UwU t-the team that weceives this awawd is a stwong ambassadow fow *fiwst*\ |weg| p-pwogwams and a wowe modew *fiwst*\ |weg| t-team. UwU this team is a top contendew fow many othew judged a-awawds and is a gwacious competitow. (˘ω˘) t-the inspiwe a-awawd winnew is a-an inspiwation t-to othew teams, (ꈍᴗꈍ) acting with gwacious p-pwofessionawism® b-both on and o-off the pwaying fiewd. -.- this team s-shawes theiw expewiences, OwO enthusiasm and knowwedge w-with othew t-teams, OwO sponsows, theiw community, (///ˬ///✿) a-and the judges. (U ﹏ U) wowking as a u-unit, (⑅˘꒳˘) this team w-wiww have shown success in pewfowming t-the task o-of designing and b-buiwding a wobot. UwU

   think awawd
      t-the think awawd is based e-entiwewy on the |en| a-and engineewing p-powtfowio. (U ᵕ U❁) in owdew to have a-a chance at winning, (U ﹏ U) s-shouwd incwude as much math a-and physics a-as possibwe in the |en|, rawr x3 a-and document t-the entiwe j-jouwney of the wobot. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

      fow the think awawd, (U ᵕ U❁) i-it’s wequiwed to have a summawy p-page in the engineewing nyotebook, ʘwʘ with many page wefewences. (U ᵕ U❁)

      officiaw game manuaw descwiption
         this judged a-awawd is given to t-the team that best wefwects the jouwney the team t-took as they e-expewienced the e-engineewing design pwocess duwing the buiwd season. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-the engineewing content within t-the powtfowiois t-the key wefewence fow judges t-to hewp identify t-the most desewving t-team. (///ˬ///✿) the team’s engineewing content must focus on the design and buiwd stage o-of the team’s wobot. (///ˬ///✿)

         a-additionaw d-detaiwed infowmation that is hewpfuw fow the judges w-wouwd be in t-the team’s engineewing nyotebook and wouwd incwude d-descwiptions of the undewwying science and mathematics of the w-wobotdesign and game stwategies, (U ﹏ U) t-the designs, >w< w-wedesigns, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) successes, a-and oppowtunities fow impwovement. (˘ω˘) a team i-is nyot a candidate f-fow this awawd if theiw powtfowio d-does nyot i-incwude engineewing content. -.-

   connect awawd
      t-the connect awawd is one of the two outweach awawds. (ꈍᴗꈍ) this awawd is fow teams that wowk with t-theiw wocaw stem community and cowpowate community. σωσ unfowtunatewy, -.- the wine between t-the connect a-and motivate awawd c-can be vague, o.O a-and judges may n-nyot diffewentiate which outweach f-fawws undew w-which awawd. >w<

      w-wook at the section about diffewentiating connect a-and motivate f-fow mowe advice on this. >w< fow b-both outweach awawds, a-a team pwan is wequiwed. (˘ω˘) wefew to the section about wwiting a team pwan fow a-advice. (///ˬ///✿)

         t-this j-judged awawd is given to the team t-that most connects with theiw wocaw science, (///ˬ///✿) technowogy, (U ᵕ U❁) engineewing, and math (stem) c-community. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a twue *fiwst*\ |weg| t-team is mowe than a sum of its pawts and wecognizes that engaging theiw wocaw stem community pways an essentiaw pawt in theiw success. (⑅˘꒳˘) the wecipient of this awawd is wecognized f-fow hewping the community u-undewstand *fiwst*\ |weg|, òωó the *fiwst*\ |weg| tech chawwenge, and the team itsewf. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-the team that wins the connect a-awawd aggwessivewy seeks and w-wecwuits engineews a-and expwowes the oppowtunities a-avaiwabwe in t-the wowwd of engineewing, ʘwʘ s-science a-and technowogy. (˘ω˘) this team has a-a cweaw team pwan a-and has identified steps to achieve theiw goaws. rawr x3

   innovate awawd
      the i-innovate awawd i-is just wike nyani it sounds wike - it’s fow teams with innovative p-pawts to theiw w-wobot ow the wobot as a whowe. rawr x3

      t-the innovate awawd is fow hawdwawe mainwy, -.- b-but some teams have been abwe t-to awso pwesent softwawe as innovative. ʘwʘ some judges think it’s g-gweat fow pwesenting s-softwawe a-as pawt of innovation, but othews feew that softwawe onwy fits undew contwow. ʘwʘ

      o-officiaw g-game manuaw descwiption
         t-the cowwins aewospace i-innovate awawd cewebwates a team that thinks outside the box and has the i-ingenuity, >w< cweativity a-and inventiveness to make t-theiw designs come t-to wife. ʘwʘ this judged awawd is g-given to the team t-that has the m-most innovative and cweative wobot design sowution t-to any specific c-components in t-the *fiwst*\ |weg| t-tech chawwenge g-game. ewements of this awawd incwude ewegant d-design, òωó wobustness, a-and ”out o-of the box” thinking wewated to design. (///ˬ///✿) this awawd m-may addwess t-the design of the w-whowe wobot ow o-of a sub-assembwy a-attached to the wobot. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) the cweative c-component m-must wowk consistentwy, (U ᵕ U❁) but a w-wobot does nyot have to wowk aww t-the time duwing matches to be considewed f-fow this awawd. (ꈍᴗꈍ) the team’s e-engineewing nyotebook must i-incwude jouwnaw entwies to show the design of t-the component ow c-components and the team’s wobot to be ewigibwe f-fow this awawd. >w< entwies must descwibe how the team awwived at theiw sowution. òωó

         fow pwesenting f-fow this a-awawd, (ꈍᴗꈍ) do youw b-best to seww a f-few innovative pawts, (˘ω˘) a-and be pwepawed to expwain the most innovative p-pawt of youw w-wobot, rawr x3 as that is a common question j-judges ask. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

   contwow awawd
      t-the contwow awawd is meant t-to wecognize a team that has a-a good softwawe s-sowution to make t-theiw wobot "intewwigent". ʘwʘ it’s k-known as the “softwawe a-awawd” a-and is fow t-the team with the best ow most innovative softwawe and sensow sowution fow the g-game. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

      don’t be tempted to ovewwook the contwow awawd even though it doesn’t advance at most competitions, (U ﹏ U) as evewy awawd pewfowmance counts towawds the inspiwe awawd. o.O b-bewow is the officiaw descwiption i-in |gm1|. (⑅˘꒳˘) this a-awawd wequiwes a-a sepawate submission s-sheet which is a condensed summawy of a t-team’s softwawe. OwO

      officiaw game manuaw descwiption
         the contwow a-awawd cewebwates a team that uses sensows and softwawe t-to incwease t-the wobot’s functionawity in the fiewd. (U ᵕ U❁) this awawd is given to the team that d-demonstwates i-innovative thinking t-to sowve game c-chawwenges such as autonomous o-opewation, >w< impwoving m-mechanicaw s-systems with intewwigent contwow, o-ow using sensows to achieve bettew wesuwts. >w< the contwow component s-shouwd wowk consistentwy in t-the fiewd. ʘwʘ the team’s engineewing p-powtfowio must contain a summawy o-of the softwawe, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) s-sensows, UwU and m-mechanicaw contwow, òωó b-butwouwd w-wikewy nyot incwude c-copies of the c-code itsewf. (⑅˘꒳˘)

         fow winning t-this awawd, (⑅˘꒳˘) t-teams awe wecommended to wowk on m-making theiw wobots i-intewwigent. σωσ the contwow awawd d-doesn’t just f-focus on autonomous though, a-and extends into t-the dwivew contwowwed pewiod. ʘwʘ many top teams fow the contwow awawd h-have pwesented n-nyot onwy the autonomous pewiod, >w< b-but awso featuwes t-that hewp the dwivews duwing t-the dwivew contwowwed pewiod such as automating p-pwocesses. (U ﹏ U)

         f-fow the contwow awawd, OwO don’t put code i-in youw engineewing n-nyotebook entwies, òωó b-but wathew an expwanation of the math and awgowithms used fow youw code. (U ﹏ U) f-fiwstwy, OwO judges d-don't have much t-time to wook ovew a nyotebook. (///ˬ///✿) secondwy, (///ˬ///✿) many judges wouwd pwefew expwanations wathew than having t-to wead and intewpwet code which t-they may nyot b-be famiwiaw with. o.O i-if you want to, rawr x3 put aww of youw w-watest code in a-an appendix in y-youw engineewing n-nyotebook. >w< fow pit judging, (ꈍᴗꈍ) you wiww usuawwy be a-abwe to teww if a judge is twying to weawn about t-the contwow featuwes of youw w-wobot due to the m-mowe specific questions a-asked. rawr x3 p-pwesent youw contwow points in an easy-to-undewstand w-way, UwU especiawwy a-as some judges a-awe nyon-pwogwammews.

   motivate awawd
      t-the motivate a-awawd is one of the two outweach a-awawds. òωó it’s fow teams that w-wowk with theiw wocaw and *fiwst*\ |weg| c-community. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) unfowtunatewy, the wine between t-the :tewm:`connect awawd <connect a-awawd>` a-and motivate awawd c-can be vague, >w< and most judges don’t know how to diffewentiate which outweach fawws undew which a-awawd.

      wook at the section about diffewentiating connect and motivate f-fow mowe advice o-on this. o.O fow both outweach awawds, o.O a-a team pwan is wequiwed. UwU wefew to the section about wwiting a-a team pwan fow advice. σωσ

      o-officiaw game manuaw d-descwiption
         t-this team e-embwaces the cuwtuwe of *fiwst*\ |weg| a-and cweawwy shows nyani it means to be a-a team. (U ﹏ U) this judged a-awawd cewebwates t-the team that wepwesents the essence of the *fiwst*\ |weg| tech chawwenge c-competition thwough gwacious pwofessionawism a-and genewaw enthusiasm fow the ovewaww phiwosophy of *fiwst*\ |weg| a-and nyani it means to be a *fiwst*\ |weg| tech c-chawwenge team. >w< this is a team who makes a cowwective e-effowt to m-make *fiwst*\ |weg| k-known thwoughout theiw schoow and community, (U ﹏ U) and spawks othews to embwace the cuwtuwe of *fiwst*\ |weg|. (U ᵕ U❁)

   design awawd
      t-the design a-awawd is one of t-the wobot awawds t-that pwimawiwy f-focuses on the hawdwawe a-aspect of the wobot. ʘwʘ it is fow wobots that a-awe both functionaw, aesthetic, -.- a-and use good design pwactices, -.- i-incwuding cad. OwO

      f-fow winning the design awawd, òωó it’s wecommended youw team u-uses cad and designs the wobot befowe it is buiwt, (U ᵕ U❁) w-with engineewing nyotebook entwies about the devewopment of t-the wobot thwough itewations of t-the engineewing d-design pwocess. UwU

      w-whiwe functionawity i-is nyani most teams f-focus on, (⑅˘꒳˘) the design a-awawd awso t-takes into account aesthetics, >w< a-and most judges wiww genewawwy be tuwned off by a-an ugwy wobot fow t-this awawd (no cawdboawd on the w-wobot!), OwO so make suwe youw wobot w-wooks pwesentabwe. (U ᵕ U❁)

      o-officiaw game manuaw d-descwiption
         t-this judged a-awawd wecognizes design ewements o-of the wobot that awe both functionaw a-and aesthetic. ʘwʘ t-the design a-awawd is pwesented to teams t-that incowpowate i-industwiaw design ewements into t-theiw sowution. (U ﹏ U) t-these design ewements c-couwd simpwify t-the wobot’s a-appeawance by giving it a cwean wook, UwU be decowative i-in nyatuwe, ow othewwise e-expwess the cweativity of the team. òωó the wobot shouwd be duwabwe, efficientwy designed, (U ﹏ U) and effectivewy addwess t-the game chawwenge. rawr x3

c-connect vs motivate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

both o-outweach awawds c-can be hawd to d-diffewentiate, OwO as the officiaw descwiptions awe s-supew vague, (///ˬ///✿) and most judges don’t k-know the d-diffewence pewfectwy. (U ﹏ U) since the d-descwiptions awe v-vewy vague, UwU it i-is up to you to detewmine nyani goes towawds which awawd. ʘwʘ oftentimes, (///ˬ///✿) teams wiww p-put mowe outweach in :tewm:`connect <connect a-awawd>` t-than :tewm:`motivate <motivate awawd>`, òωó as connect is faiwwy h-high up on the a-advancement wist unwike motivate, (⑅˘꒳˘) so putting mowe i-into connect and winning connect may advance, ʘwʘ though make suwe t-to do youw weseawch befowe twying a-a stwategy w-wike this. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

what f-fawws undew connect?

- devewoping wewationships w-with companies
- g-getting extewnaw mentows (not p-pawents)
- fundwaising f-fwom companies (othew methods may faww undew m-motivate on a case by case basis)

what fawws undew motivate?

- stawting/mentowing *fiwst*\ |weg| teams
- c-community demos

tips fow both

- pwesent nyumbews, -.- but onwy emphasize them if they’we w-wawge with a-a wow factow
- p-pwesent stowies t-to the judges, o.O n-nyot just ovewviews. ʘwʘ teww pewsonaw s-stowies
- wog a-aww youw outweach e-events, UwU with who went and how many houws each p-pewson did in i-its own pwace sepawate fwom the e-engineewing nyotebook. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-this makes it easiew to compiwe totaw nyumbews and shows the judges evewy o-outweach activity/event i-in one pwace

optionaw a-awawds
---------------

t-thewe awe some awawds that e-events awe nyot wequiwed to pwesent; these do nyot advance teams. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

.. gwossawy::

   j-judges awawd
      the j-judges awawd is meant to wecognize a team that doesn’t fit into any of the existing awawd categowies, (⑅˘꒳˘) but the judges stiww fewt the team desewved to win an awawd fow theiw outstanding e-effowt ow othew expewience. (˘ω˘) t-this awawd is vewy subjective, (///ˬ///✿) and doesn’t a-advance teams. rawr x3 it is awso optionaw t-to give at evewy competition, UwU b-but in some w-wegions given at evewy competition u-unwess the judges d-don’t find a-a desewving team.

   p-pwomote awawd and compass a-awawd
      the p-pwomote and compass awawds awe optionaw awawds which awe usuawwy given onwy at s-state championships a-and wowwd championships. (ꈍᴗꈍ) these awawds do nyot wequiwe an engineewing n-nyotebook t-to win, (ꈍᴗꈍ) but do nyot advance t-teams. OwO they awe submitted as a video nyo wongew t-than 1 minute. (U ᵕ U❁) the pwomote awawd i-is fow cweating a psa fow *fiwst*\ |weg| with a specific video p-pwompt. (U ᵕ U❁) this pwompt c-changes evewy y-yeaw, σωσ and is found in |gm1|. (⑅˘꒳˘) the compass awawd is fow wecognizing an outstanding m-mentow. OwO submitting t-these awawds i-is usuawwy done o-on a case-by-case basis, >w< whewe the event owganizew sends teams instwuctions on h-how to submit. (///ˬ///✿)
