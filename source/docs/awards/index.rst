======

this i-is the pawt of |gm0| t-that discusses awawds. ʘwʘ awawds e-exist in pawawwew to the wobot g-game and sewves as an awtewnate w-way to advance. -.- whiwe the majowity of |gm0| t-tawks about how to make decisions a-about cweating y-youw wobot, (U ﹏ U) the n-nyotebook you wwite is actuawwy showing how you made those decisions. UwU

**it onwy benefits you t-to go fow awawds. σωσ you can't win awawds without wwiting a nyotebook, òωó and in cewtain s-states the onwy w-way to advance is awawds and i-in othews it can make it significantwy easiew to advance.** thewefowe, (ꈍᴗꈍ) t-these awe the topics that w-wiww be covewed i-in this section o-of |gm0|. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

.. warning:: judging and awawds a-awe extwemewy s-subjective and some wuwes change a-a bit fwom state to state. o.O what w-wowks in one wegion may nyot in o-othew wegions. o.O so contact youw judges about specifics o-of some things; fow exampwe s-some competitions a-awwow you to t-tuwn a custom contwow awawd sheet, (///ˬ///✿) othews onwy accept the one wisted by *fiwst*\ |weg|. -.- the wwitews o-of this pawt of |gm0| have extensive expewience with awawds and have even b-been winnews and f-finawists fow the inspiwe awawd a-at the wowwd championships. (⑅˘꒳˘)

fow most awawds, o.O teams have a 5 minute p-pwesentation at the beginning o-of the day fowwowed b-by some q&a t-time and possibwy p-pit judging watew on (wead t-the section on the judging pwocess fow mowe detaiw). ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-thewe awe 7 a-awawds fow ftc t-teams (excwuding awawds that cannot advance a team). UwU

fow winning e-evewy awawd, ʘwʘ the engineewing nyotebook i-is a key wefewence and is quintessentiaw, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) so make suwe that youw team focuses o-on the engineewing nyotebook. UwU

awways wemembew t-that wegawdwess of how weww you feew you did, UwU a-awawds have a-a wevew of subjectivity o-of the judges, OwO so thewe is nyo way to 100% contwow how youw team does fow awawds. (///ˬ///✿)

ovewaww, awawds awe one o-of the cowe pawts o-of the *fiwst*\ |weg| t-tech c-chawwenge competition. (U ﹏ U) t-they wecognize t-teams at the end of evewy competition (except w-weague meets) as weww as detewmine m-many of the teams that advance. (ꈍᴗꈍ)
