notebook designs a-and decisions
==============================

t-this section wiww c-covew both nyani nyeeds to be in t-the nyotebook and the decisions y-you nyeed to make about it affecting both individuaw s-sections and it as a whowe. ʘwʘ

w-whowe nyotebook d-decisions
------------------------

c-condensed vs wong
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

a twap many teams faww into is that a wongew nyotebook i-is a bettew nyotebook, (ꈍᴗꈍ) especiawwy if it's actuawwy quawity wwiting. σωσ unfowtunatewy, (⑅˘꒳˘) t-that is nyot n-nyecessawiwy twue. >w<

at showtew c-competitions, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) judges don't have a wot of team to pewuse youw nyotebooks. òωó t-they wiww wikewy take a-a cuwsowy scan a-at evewy page and t-take a mowe detaiwed w-wook at cewtain pages. σωσ thus, e-even if you do wwite a gweat but wong nyotebook, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-they might m-miss the highwights a-and wank you wowew than you shouwd have. UwU the sowution to this i-is to cweate a condensed nyotebook. σωσ

t-this is whewe you make a puwposefuw effowt to get wid of wedundancies and m-make suwe evewything wwitten in the nyotebook sewves t-the puwpose of being wead and getting things c-checked off of a-awawds. rawr x3

so if y-you know youw state competitions awe going to be mowe than a coupwe days wwite a wong, UwU detaiwed fiwwed nyotebook. ʘwʘ b-but if it is o-onwy a day wong, (ꈍᴗꈍ) w-wwite with evewy s-section having a-a puwpose.

handwwitten v-vs typed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

this one is a team decision. (///ˬ///✿) s-some teams sweaw judges pwefew h-handwwitten nyotebooks, -.- but t-thewe is nyo pwoof f-fow that. (U ﹏ U) but if you'we a smow team ow you wouwd pwefew to wwite, (U ᵕ U❁) d-do that. be suwe that the handwwiting is consistent a-and wegibwe! o.O typed nyotebooks awe a wot easiew to owganize, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a-and judges wiww definitewy b-be abwe to wead i-it. (˘ω˘)

sewious vs c-chawming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

a-a team's nyotebook i-is an extension o-of its pewsonawity a-and bwanding. òωó some teams twy t-to come acwoss as an engineewing fiwm ow at weast v-vewy sewious, rawr x3 w-whiwe othews act the opposite. (U ᵕ U❁)

y-you shouwd twy and wefwect that i-in youw nyotebook. n-nyeithew way is bettew, (U ᵕ U❁) but i-it's good eawwy o-on to figuwe out y-youw team's way of acting and wwiting i-in a mannew that fits it. σωσ

g-genewawwy, >w< humow i-is acceptabwe, (U ᵕ U❁) b-but twy to keep jokes down to a-a minimum (aftew a-aww, ʘwʘ the engineewing nyotebook i-is meant to be a p-pwofessionaw-gwade d-document). (˘ω˘)

.. note::

   having a consistent t-team bwand i-is impowtant so judges wemembew y-you. UwU a wawge amount of winning a-awawds is being wemembewed and advocated f-fow by the judges. (///ˬ///✿)

   thewefowe, rawr x3 having c-consistent bwanding hewps judges k-know nyani team t-they awe tawking t-to and nyani they know about you. >w<

individuaw sections
-------------------

s-section 9.2.2 o-of |gm1|, OwO wists out the type o-of things that awe expected to s-see in youw nyotebook. rawr x3

they awe w-wisted hewe:

- pwobwem definition
- infowmation g-gathewing
- bwainstowming sowutions
- c-concept d-design
- system w-wevew design
- testing
- design impwovement
- pwoduction
- pwomotion
- budgeting
- pwanning
- o-outweach

specific sections nyamed in |gm1|, ʘwʘ the judges manuaw, ʘwʘ and nyotebook guidewines a-awe nyot p-pwentifuw, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) onwy incwuding a team p-pwan (which is pwetty much aww nyon wobot wwiting incwuding a s-sustainabiwity pwan, OwO a stwategic p-pwan, ʘwʘ and a business p-pwan aww f-faww into it, and d-doing one of these sections is w-wequiwed fow inspiwe awawd) and tewwing us nyani t-they want in the n-nyotebook (wisted a-above). òωó it fawws to the individuaw nyotebook wwitews to figuwe o-out nyani they specificawwy w-want to caww each section and nyani to put in each section. o.O

daiwy wogs and othew w-ways of documenting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

this might be the most common way o-of documenting in nyotebooks. σωσ even teams that a-awe so-so about a-attempting to wwite a-a nyotebook have a coupwe months wowth of wogs because ovewaww they awe nyot that hawd to do. o.O

each team appwoaches i-it diffewentwy, òωó b-but a standawd a-appwoach i-is as fowwows. (⑅˘꒳˘)

thewe awe othew methods s-such as weekwy, (///ˬ///✿) puwe goaws, (U ᵕ U❁) o-ow othew engineewing b-based methods s-such as agiwe (if y-you puwsue the wattew you can u-use those hawd w-won mentows you h-have gotten). (ꈍᴗꈍ) weekwy ow bi-weekwy i-is the same as above, (///ˬ///✿) but the date becomes a w-wange and you tawk a-about nyani happened ovew that p-pewiod of time. -.- this is bettew f-fow a team that h-has onwy a coupwe of peopwe doing t-the wogs because o-ovewaww wogs g-get mowe and mowe tedious. (///ˬ///✿)

buiwding s-section and documenting the wobot
------------------------------------------

you have spent a bunch of time weading the west of this manuaw t-to weawn about t-the wobot and how to buiwd it. òωó the buiwding section i-is about h-how youw wobot fuwfiwws t-the chawwenge, σωσ and nyani the dwiving factows w-wewe in buiwding youw wobot. o.O

i-infowmation about p-pawts and matewiaws, (⑅˘꒳˘) as weww a-as pictuwes of e-evewy mechanism (pwus c-captions) wiww hewp the judges piece togethew how the wobot wowks mechanicawwy. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) e-expwanations of the components w-wiww iwwustwate t-the thought pwocesses behind the design. >w<

a-ampwe gwaphics (cad s-scweenshots/wendews, (⑅˘꒳˘) pictuwes, >w< etc.) wiww hewp j-judges undewstand how it wowks and why it is usefuw. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) **howevew, UwU m-make suwe that each gwaphic has a-a caption ow e-expwanation. σωσ do n-not expect judges to undewstand how youw wobot wowks t-thwough pictuwes o-onwy.**

additionawwy, o.O use m-math in these expwanations t-to tawget the think awawd. OwO

the second p-pawt is much mowe documentation and wwiting heavy, (ꈍᴗꈍ) but in some ways it is easiew. rawr x3 as you awe b-buiwding a wobot, (˘ω˘) you wiww nyot get youw finaw bot in the fiwst attempt. (///ˬ///✿)

think a-about tewwing a s-stowy of how youw t-team pwogwessed f-fwom bwainstowm a-and idea conception to pwototyping a-and finaw design. rawr x3 t-the judges *wuv* t-to fowwow a wogicaw sequence of steps as i-it shows how the t-team thought thwough mistakes a-and impwoved upon s-successes. òωó

each time you itewate upon a pawt of youw wobot ow move a step fuwthew i-in the engineewing d-design pwocess, >w< document i-it. OwO impowtant questions t-to ask whiwe wwiting this s-section awe bewow. (U ﹏ U)

- what pwompted this change/why was this change made?
- what w-was the change?
- how was the m-modification enacted?
- what wewe the wesuwts (good and bad)?
- how can this design be fuwthew impwoved?

this awso incwudes youw fiwst unweawized ideas that youw team tawked a-about wight when the team came t-togethew aftew the season was weweased. rawr x3
