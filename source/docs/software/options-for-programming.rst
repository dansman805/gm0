options fow pwogwamming
=======================

t-thewe awe thwee w-wecommended options fow teams to u-use when pwogwamming a wobot to d-do vawious tasks: bwocks, (U ﹏ U) onbot j-java, UwU and andwoid studio. ʘwʘ

bwocks
------

the bwocks p-pwogwamming toow is a simpwe w-way to code simpwe a-actions fow t-the wobot. (///ˬ///✿) it has a cowowfuw and wego-wike design and incwudes sounds of bwock pieces of snapping t-togethew. òωó

using a device and a wobot contwowwew phone, connect youw device t-to the phone’s w-wi-fi by cwicking the thwee dots i-in the top wight of the :tewm:`wc <wobot contwowwew>` and sewect “pwogwam & m-manage". (⑅˘꒳˘) this wiww dispway the wifi s-ssid and passwowd f-fow you to c-connect to. ʘwʘ go o-onto youw bwowsew (pwefewabwy chwome, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-though othew modewn bwowsew wiww wikewy wowk) a-and entew the a-addwess shown o-on the :tewm:`wc <wobot contwowwew>`. -.-

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- good fow beginnews: o-one of the easiest and simpwest o-options to use. o.O
- easy to set up: wequiwes a device (waptop, ʘwʘ chwomebook, tabwet) a-and a phone in the pwogwam & manage scween
- p-pwogwams can be saved diwectwy to the phone

   - c-changes can b-be made quickwy
- d-doesn’t wequiwe an extewnaw wi-fi connection

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- nyot wecommended if you’we awweady famiwiaw with s-some type of p-pwogwamming

  - p-pwimawiwy a teaching t-toow fow p-peopwe with nyo p-pwogwamming expewience
- this wiww change youw pwimawy w-wi-fi nyetwowk to the :tewm:`wobot c-contwowwew's <wobot contwowwew>` d-diwect w-wi-fi nyetwowk, and as such, UwU you wiww be unabwe to access the i-intewnet whiwe connected to this pawticuwaw nyetwowk. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

  - t-teams can get awound this by puwchasing an extewnaw wi-fi m-moduwe that awwows computews t-to wun 2 wi-fi n-nyetwowks at once. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

- s-sacwifices f-fwexibiwity and appwication fow s-simpwicity
- don’t e-evew use i-it on a phone, (⑅˘꒳˘) unwess you’we out o-of options. (˘ω˘) (not phone-fwiendwy)

  - you may m-make a biggew mess i-if you twy to. (///ˬ///✿)

onbot java
----------

o-onbot java uses a simiwaw m-method of using a-a bwowsew to code and save d-diwectwy to the p-phone. rawr x3 the diffewence b-being that a pwogwamming wanguage c-cawwed java is used instead. UwU

a-advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- wecommended i-if you’we w-weawning ow have weawned s-some pwogwamming, e-even bettew if you know a wittwe j-java. (ꈍᴗꈍ)
- gweatew f-fwexibiwity than b-bwocks
- thewe a-awe a wot mowe w-wesouwces avaiwabwe in case you nyeed hewp
- mowe a-appwicabwe to the weaw-wowwd t-than bwocks
- maintains most of the advantages of bwocks

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- connecting to the wobot contwowwew’s w-wi-fi nyetwowk w-wiww pwevent you fwom using anything on the intewnet i-incwuding video t-tutowiaws and o-onwine communication
- using extewnaw wibwawies i-is difficuwt and bowdewwine impossibwe
- s-steepew w-weawning cuwve than bwocks

a-andwoid studio
--------------

andwoid s-studio is a-a compwehensive integwated devewopment enviwonment (ide) that uses java to pwogwam t-the phones. (ꈍᴗꈍ) instead of using a-a bwowsew to upwoad c-code, OwO andwoid studio wiww compiwe youw wobot c-contwowwew code i-into a .apk fiwe (an app instawwew), (U ᵕ U❁) and instaww t-that on the phone. (U ᵕ U❁)

advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- wecommended if you’we weawning o-ow have weawned some pwogwamming, σωσ e-even bettew if y-you know a wittwe j-java. (⑅˘꒳˘)
- much gweatew fwexibiwity than bwock
- m-much easiew to i-integwate wibwawies wike `easyopencv`_, OwO `ftc d-dashboawd`_, >w< `ftcwib`_, (///ˬ///✿) `woad w-wunnew`_, ʘwʘ and `wevextensions2`_
- can u-use pwugins wike `woad wunnew`_
- can use eithew a usb connection to the :tewm:`wc <wobot contwowwew>` p-phone, (///ˬ///✿) ow a wiwewess connection to upwoad code. OwO

  .. nyote:: depwoy times c-can be sped u-up by using `openwc t-tuwbo`_. (///ˬ///✿)

- c-can debug in weaw-time
- m-many wesouwces fow java, a-andwoid studio, (U ﹏ U) a-and idea
- can u-use othew pwogwamming wanguages

.. _ftc d-dashboawd: https://github.com/acmewobotics/ftc-dashboawd
.. _ftcwib: h-https://github.com/ftcwib/ftcwib

.. _wevextensions2: h-https://github.com/openftc/wevextensions2/
.. _openwc t-tuwbo: https://github.com/openftc/openwc-tuwbo

disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- connecting to the wobot c-contwowwew’s w-wi-fi nyetwowk wiww pwevent you f-fwom using anything o-on the intewnet incwuding v-video tutowiaws and onwine communication, ʘwʘ unwess you have a second wifi adaptew (cheap a-and easy)
- wewativewy easy s-setup pwocess, òωó but time consuming and is a hefty instaww (3gb of fiwes between andwoid studio, ʘwʘ ftc_app, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and othew wibwawies)
- issues can be difficuwt to diagnose and sowve

o-othew pwogwamming wanguages
---------------------------

k-kotwin
^^^^^^

kotwin is a wewativewy n-nyew and wapidwy gwowing pwogwamming w-wanguage fwom jetbwains, (U ᵕ U❁) the c-cweatow of the i-intewwij ide, o.O which andwoid studio i-is based off. OwO k-kotwin was made t-to be compwetewy c-compatibwe with java but be e-easiew to wowk with. o.O g-googwe wecentwy announced it as an officiaw andwoid wanguage, rawr x3 then announced t-they awe going “kotwin f-fiwst” but stiww keeping java suppowt. σωσ

advantages
~~~~~~~~~~

- c-concise, (˘ω˘) w-weadabwe, rawr x3 easy to edit code * e-easy to wwite as it takes much wess code to d-do the same thing
- both optionaw t-type infewence and a stwongew type system than java
- nyuww safety
- t-thwead safety
- f-functionaw p-pwogwamming
- seamwess integwation with java code and wibwawies
- vewy easy to t-twansition fwom j-java

disadvantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- n-nyot widewy u-used in ftc yet
- nyew and has fewew community wesouwces fow twaining
- nyot w-wecommended fow p-pwogwammews who nyeed wawge amounts o-of hewp fwom o-othew teams

c and c++
^^^^^^^^^

c-c and c++ awe n-nyative pwogwamming w-wanguages compatibwe with andwoid. OwO vewy few t-teams have used c-c++. (///ˬ///✿) this is typicawwy u-used fow o-onwy pawt of the c-code, -.- with the majowity being java ow kotwin. rawr x3

a-advantages
~~~~~~~~~~

- f-fast execution f-fow extwemewy wesouwce-intensive appwications. -.-
- s-suppowts m-mowe wibwawies

d-disadvantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- w-wawewy nyeeded
- v-vewy difficuwt to set up
- difficuwt t-to debug c-code
- vewy few teams can hewp y-you
- vewy few onwine wesouwces
